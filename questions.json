    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents with right-sided facial droop. He is unable to raise his right eyebrow, close his right eye tightly, or smile on the right side. He also reports hyperacusis and decreased taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Where is the most likely location of the facial nerve lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Stylomastoid foramen",
      "Geniculate ganglion",
      "Internal acoustic meatus",
      "Parotid gland",
      "Brainstem motor nucleus of CN VII"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "A lesion at the internal acoustic meatus affects the facial nerve before it exits the skull, involving all its branches. This includes motor innervation to the face, chorda tympani (taste), and the nerve to stapedius (hyperacusis). A lesion here explains the complete right facial paralysis with taste and auditory symptoms. - A. Stylomastoid foramen: Incorrect. Lesions here cause facial muscle paralysis but do NOT affect taste or hearing.- B. Geniculate ganglion: Incorrect. While taste fibers pass through here, hyperacusis (due to stapedius involvement) would suggest a lesion before the nerve to stapedius branches off.- C. Internal acoustic meatus: Correct. Affects all components of CN VII before it enters the facial canal.- D. Parotid gland: Incorrect. Damage here affects only the terminal branches of CN VII — facial expression muscles — not taste or hearing.- E. Brainstem motor nucleus of CN VII: Incorrect. A lesion here causes a central (upper motor neuron) pattern of facial weakness (spares forehead). This patient has a lower motor neuron pattern."

    "question": "A 17-year-old male presents with periorbital swelling and headache following manipulation of an inflamed pimple on his upper lip. MRI reveals cavernous sinus thrombosis. Which venous route most likely allowed retrograde spread of infection to the cavernous sinus?",
    "choices": [
      "Retromandibular vein → external jugular vein",
      "Facial vein → angular vein → superior ophthalmic vein → cavernous sinus",
      "Superficial temporal vein → internal jugular vein",
      "Pterygoid venous plexus → maxillary vein → external jugular vein",
      "Deep facial vein → facial vein → subclavian vein"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The valveless facial vein communicates with the angular and ophthalmic veins, which connect directly to the cavernous sinus. This enables retrograde spread of infection from the midface ('danger triangle') to intracranial venous sinuses. - A. Retromandibular vein → external jugular vein: Incorrect. Drains posteriorly and does not communicate with the cavernous sinus.- B. Facial vein → angular vein → superior ophthalmic vein → cavernous sinus: Correct. This is the direct route for spread of infection to the cavernous sinus.- C. Superficial temporal vein → internal jugular vein: Incorrect. Not involved in anterior facial drainage.- D. Pterygoid venous plexus → maxillary vein → external jugular vein: Incorrect. This pathway doesn't lead to the cavernous sinus.- E. Deep facial vein → facial vein → subclavian vein: Incorrect. While the deep facial vein can anastomose with pterygoid plexus, the path to the cavernous sinus involves the superior ophthalmic vein, not this route."

    "question": "A 64-year-old woman presents with episodes of sharp, electric shock-like pain over her right cheek and upper lip, often triggered by light touch or brushing teeth. Neurological examination is normal between attacks. Which nerve division is most likely affected?",
    "choices": [
      "Ophthalmic nerve (CN V1)",
      "Maxillary nerve (CN V2)",
      "Mandibular nerve (CN V3)",
      "Facial nerve (CN VII)",
      "Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly affects the maxillary division (CN V2), which innervates the upper lip and cheek. It presents with paroxysmal, lancinating facial pain often triggered by light stimulation.- A. Ophthalmic nerve (CN V1): Incorrect. This would cause pain in the forehead and upper scalp, not the cheek.- B. Maxillary nerve (CN V2): Correct. Innervates the cheek, upper lip, and lateral nose — classic trigeminal neuralgia location.- C. Mandibular nerve (CN V3): Incorrect. Would affect the jaw, chin, and temple regions, not the midface.- D. Facial nerve (CN VII): Incorrect. Primarily motor to facial muscles, not responsible for somatic facial sensation.- E. Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX): Incorrect. Involved in posterior tongue, pharynx, and ear sensation — not facial dermatomes."

  "question": "A 66-year-old right-handed man is brought in by his daughter, who reports that he only shaves the right side of his face, eats food from the right side of his plate, and ignores people approaching him from the left. Neurologic exam reveals left-sided spatial neglect. Which of the following brain regions is most likely damaged?",
  "choices": [
    "Left inferior parietal lobule",
    "Right inferior parietal lobule",
    "Left superior temporal gyrus",
    "Right frontal lobe",
    "Left cuneus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This patient's presentation is classic for hemispatial neglect syndrome, typically resulting from a lesion in the non-dominant (right) inferior parietal lobule. This area integrates spatial attention, and right-sided lesions lead to left-sided neglect in most right-handed individuals.- A. Left inferior parietal lobule: Incorrect. A lesion here can affect language functions in the dominant hemisphere but does not cause hemispatial neglect.- B. Right inferior parietal lobule: Correct. Damage here leads to left visual field neglect due to impaired visuospatial attention.- C. Left superior temporal gyrus: Incorrect. Associated with Wernicke’s area and language comprehension, not spatial awareness.- D. Right frontal lobe: Incorrect. While frontal lobe lesions can cause motor or planning deficits, spatial neglect is more commonly linked to the parietal lobe.- E. Left cuneus: Incorrect. Involved in visual processing of the inferior visual field, not responsible for attention or neglect."

  "question": "A 58-year-old right-handed woman presents with slurred speech but intact comprehension. She is frustrated by her inability to articulate words and frequently struggles to write sentences. Neurological imaging reveals a lesion in the dominant frontal lobe. Which of the following best describes this patient’s condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Wernicke's aphasia",
    "Broca's aphasia",
    "Conduction aphasia",
    "Anomic aphasia",
    "Transcortical sensory aphasia"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This patient has Broca's aphasia, which results from a lesion in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis and pars triangularis) of the dominant hemisphere. It is characterized by non-fluent, effortful speech with preserved comprehension.- A. Wernicke's aphasia: Incorrect. Wernicke's affects the posterior superior temporal gyrus, causing fluent but meaningless speech and impaired comprehension.- B. Broca's aphasia: Correct. Caused by a lesion in Broca’s area in the dominant frontal lobe, presenting with impaired speech production and writing.- C. Conduction aphasia: Incorrect. This results from arcuate fasciculus damage and primarily affects repetition, not speech production or comprehension.- D. Anomic aphasia: Incorrect. Characterized by word-finding difficulty with preserved fluency and comprehension, usually due to lesions in temporal or parietal regions.- E. Transcortical sensory aphasia: Incorrect. Similar to Wernicke’s but with preserved repetition; comprehension remains impaired."

    "Middle cerebral artery",
    "Anterior cerebral artery",
    "Posterior cerebral artery",
    "Anterior choroidal artery",
    "Basilar artery"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of an anterior cerebral artery (ACA) stroke. The ACA supplies the medial portions of the frontal and parietal lobes, including the paracentral lobule responsible for motor and sensory function of the lower limb.- A. Middle cerebral artery: Incorrect. MCA strokes affect the lateral hemispheres, typically involving the face and arm more than the leg.- B. Anterior cerebral artery: Correct. The ACA supplies the medial frontal and parietal lobes, affecting the lower extremity on the contralateral side.- C. Posterior cerebral artery: Incorrect. Supplies the occipital lobe (visual cortex) and inferior temporal lobe, not motor or sensory cortex.- D. Anterior choroidal artery: Incorrect. Involved in deep structures like the internal capsule and thalamus; deficits would be more widespread.- E. Basilar artery: Incorrect. Supplies the brainstem and cerebellum, not the cerebral cortex."

  "question": "A 48-year-old man undergoes resection of a benign parotid gland tumor. Postoperatively, he presents with asymmetry of the face, inability to close his right eye tightly, and drooping of the right corner of his mouth. However, salivary secretion from the parotid gland remains intact. Which of the following best explains this pattern of findings?",
  "choices": [
    "Damage to postganglionic parasympathetic fibers traveling with the auriculotemporal nerve",
    "Injury to the facial nerve within the parotid gland, which does not innervate the gland itself",
    "Transection of the glossopharyngeal nerve proximal to the otic ganglion",
    "Lesion of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3)",
    "Compression of the external carotid artery within the parotid gland"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This clinical picture reflects injury to the facial nerve (CN VII) within the parotid gland. Although CN VII gives off its five terminal motor branches inside the gland, it does not innervate the gland itself—parasympathetic innervation comes from CN IX via the otic ganglion and auriculotemporal nerve. Thus, facial weakness with preserved parotid function suggests damage to CN VII within the gland.- A. Damage to postganglionic parasympathetic fibers traveling with the auriculotemporal nerve: Incorrect. Would impair salivation but not cause facial droop.- B. Injury to the facial nerve within the parotid gland, which does not innervate the gland itself: Correct. Explains isolated facial muscle weakness with intact salivation.- C. Transection of the glossopharyngeal nerve proximal to the otic ganglion: Incorrect. Would impair parotid secretion."

    "question": "A 63-year-old man presents with new onset hemiparesis and loss of proprioception on the right side of his body. Neurologic exam shows decreased vibration sense and conscious proprioception in the right upper and lower limbs, along with a positive Romberg sign. Which of the following is the most likely location of the lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Right lateral corticospinal tract in the cervical spinal cord",
      "Left dorsal column at the level of the medulla",
      "Right medial lemniscus in the midbrain",
      "Left anterior horn of the cervical spinal cord",
      "Right spinothalamic tract in the thoracic spinal cord"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient shows loss of proprioception and vibration sense on the right, suggesting involvement of the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway. Because these sensations are carried ipsilaterally in the spinal cord and cross at the medulla, a lesion on the right side of the dorsal column before decussation would cause this presentation.Right lateral corticospinal tract in the cervical spinal cord: Incorrect. This would cause motor weakness but not sensory deficits like loss of proprioception.Left dorsal column at the level of the medulla: Incorrect. Lesion after decussation would affect the right side, but this would be contralateral and at the medullary level, not spinal.Right medial lemniscus in the midbrain: Incorrect. After decussation, medial lemniscus lesions cause contralateral sensory loss.Left anterior horn of the cervical spinal cord: Incorrect. This would result in lower motor neuron signs like flaccid paralysis, not sensory loss.Right spinothalamic tract in the thoracic spinal cord: Incorrect. Spinothalamic tract carries pain and temperature, not proprioception or vibration."

      "Cuneate nucleus",
      "Ventral posterior lateral nucleus",
      "Substantia gelatinosa",
      "Nucleus ambiguus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The gracile nucleus in the medulla receives sensory input from the lower half of the body (below T6) via the fasciculus gracilis. Signals decussate after synapsing here and continue via the medial lemniscus.Gracile nucleus: Correct. Receives input from the lower limbs and trunk.Cuneate nucleus: Incorrect. Receives input from the upper limbs and trunk (above T6).Ventral posterior lateral nucleus: Incorrect. This is a thalamic relay station, not the medullary nucleus receiving the first synapse.Substantia gelatinosa: Incorrect. Involved in pain modulation, not proprioception.Nucleus ambiguus: Incorrect. Motor nucleus for CN IX and X, not involved in sensory processing."

    "question": "A patient suffers a stroke affecting the anterior spinal artery at the mid-thoracic level. Which of the following deficits is most likely seen below the level of the lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Ipsilateral loss of fine touch and vibration",
      "Bilateral flaccid paralysis",
      "Contralateral pain and temperature loss with preserved fine touch",
      "Ipsilateral Horner syndrome",
      "Bilateral loss of proprioception"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Anterior spinal artery syndrome at the thoracic level affects the spinothalamic tracts (which cross in the anterior white commissure) and lateral corticospinal tracts, sparing the dorsal columns. Therefore, patients exhibit motor weakness and contralateral pain and temperature loss, with preserved fine touch and proprioception.Ipsilateral loss of fine touch and vibration: Incorrect. These modalities are carried in the dorsal columns, which are supplied by the posterior spinal arteries.Bilateral flaccid paralysis: Incorrect. This occurs only at the level of lesion involving anterior horn cells. Below the lesion, paralysis is spastic.Contralateral pain and temperature loss with preserved fine touch: Correct. Spinothalamic tracts are affected, dorsal columns are spared.Ipsilateral Horner syndrome: Incorrect. Only seen with lesions involving the hypothalamospinal tract in the cervical region.Bilateral loss of proprioception: Incorrect. Dorsal columns (which carry proprioception) are not affected in anterior spinal artery syndrome."

    "question": "A 37-year-old man sustains a temporal bone fracture. Shortly after, he develops facial asymmetry, inability to close his left eye, and drooping of the left side of the mouth. However, his ability to wrinkle the forehead on both sides remains intact. Which of the following best describes the location of the nerve lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Intracranial lesion affecting the facial nerve nucleus",
      "Injury to the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen",
      "Cortical stroke affecting the right motor cortex",
      "Lesion in the internal acoustic meatus affecting CN VIII",
      "Compression of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This presentation describes upper motor neuron facial weakness, where the lower face is affected but the forehead is spared due to bilateral innervation. A cortical stroke (e.g., in the right motor cortex) produces contralateral facial weakness of the lower face only.  Intracranial lesion affecting the facial nerve nucleus: Incorrect. Would cause complete ipsilateral facial paralysis, not forehead sparing. Injury to the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen: Incorrect. Would cause lower motor neuron signs with total ipsilateral facial paralysis. Cortical stroke affecting the right motor cortex: Correct. Upper motor neuron lesion causes contralateral lower facial weakness with forehead sparing. Lesion in the internal acoustic meatus affecting CN VIII: Incorrect. Affects both facial and vestibulocochlear nerves, but would produce complete ipsilateral facial paralysis. Compression of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve: Incorrect. Affects mastication and facial sensation, not facial expression."

    "question": "During an autopsy, a pathologist identifies damage in the region of the foramen rotundum. Which of the following deficits would most likely be observed in a living patient with this lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Loss of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue",
      "Inability to close the eyelid on the affected side",
      "Loss of general sensation from the midface",
      "Weakness of the tongue on protrusion",
      "Absent corneal reflex (motor limb)"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The foramen rotundum transmits the maxillary division (V2) of the trigeminal nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the midface, including the lower eyelid, upper lip, and maxillary teeth.  Loss of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue: Incorrect. This is mediated by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). Inability to close the eyelid on the affected side: Incorrect. Caused by facial nerve (CN VII) paralysis. Loss of general sensation from the midface: Correct. V2 travels through the foramen rotundum and innervates the midface. Weakness of the tongue on protrusion: Incorrect. Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) damage causes tongue deviation. Absent corneal reflex (motor limb): Incorrect. The motor limb is via CN VII; V2 is only sensory."

      "Foramen ovale",
      "Foramen rotundum",
      "Hypoglossal canal",
      "Jugular foramen",
      "Stylomastoid foramen"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The jugular foramen transmits cranial nerves IX, X, and XI. Damage to CN X (vagus nerve) results in hoarseness and dysphagia due to impaired function of the laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles. Loss of gag reflex also reflects CN IX and X involvement.  Foramen ovale: Incorrect. Transmits mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve, affecting mastication. Foramen rotundum: Incorrect. Transmits maxillary division (V2), affects midface sensation. Hypoglossal canal: Incorrect. Transmits CN XII, which affects tongue movement. Jugular foramen: Correct. Transmits CN IX, X, and XI—explaining the swallowing and vocal symptoms. Stylomastoid foramen: Incorrect. Exit point for the facial nerve; would result in facial expression deficits."

    "choices": [
      "Right medial medulla",
      "Left lateral medulla",
      "Right lateral pons",
      "Left medial pons",
      "Right cervical spinal cord hemisection"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of Brown-Séquard syndrome due to a right hemisection of the cervical spinal cord. The lateral corticospinal tract (motor) and dorsal columns (vibration, proprioception) are affected ipsilaterally, while the spinothalamic tract (pain and temperature) is affected contralaterally below the lesion. Right medial medulla is incorrect because it would cause contralateral motor weakness and ipsilateral tongue weakness. Left lateral medulla is incorrect because it would cause ipsilateral loss of facial pain and temperature, contralateral body pain and temperature, and cranial nerve IX/X signs. Right lateral pons is incorrect because it would affect facial sensation and possibly CN VII. Left medial pons is incorrect as it would present with contralateral hemiparesis and possibly facial nerve deficits on the ipsilateral side."

      "Right frontal eye field",
      "Right facial colliculus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient has oculomotor nerve palsy: eye deviated down and out, ptosis, dilated pupil, and accommodation loss. These findings localize the lesion to the oculomotor nerve in the midbrain. Right abducens nucleus is incorrect because it would cause inability to abduct the eye, not a down and out position. Right trochlear nucleus is incorrect because it would cause vertical diplopia especially when looking down. Right frontal eye field is incorrect as lesions there cause conjugate gaze deviation toward the side of the lesion. Right facial colliculus is incorrect because it would cause facial weakness and horizontal gaze palsy, not eye position abnormalities."

      "Trigeminal ganglion"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "This patient has signs of a complete facial nerve lesion including motor, taste, and parasympathetic components. The lesion must be at or before the facial nerve branches off its components, which occurs within the internal acoustic meatus. Facial nerve after the stylomastoid foramen is incorrect because it would only affect motor fibers. Facial motor nucleus in the pons is incorrect as it would not involve all the additional symptoms such as hyperacusis and taste loss. Corticobulbar tract is incorrect because it would cause forehead sparing. Trigeminal ganglion is incorrect because it controls facial sensation, not motor control or taste."

    "explanation": "Diffusion-weighted MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting early ischemic changes due to its ability to identify restricted diffusion from cytotoxic edema. Contrast-enhanced head CT is not first-line in stroke unless evaluating for vascular lesions or tumors. T1-weighted MRI is better for anatomical detail, not acute ischemia. T2-weighted MRI may detect subacute stroke but lacks the sensitivity of DWI in the hyperacute phase.

      "Anterior white commissure",
      "Lateral corticospinal tract",
      "Dorsal horn"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "A syrinx in the central canal of the spinal cord compresses the anterior white commissure, where spinothalamic tract fibers cross. This leads to bilateral segmental loss of pain and temperature in a 'cape-like' distribution. Fasciculus gracilis and cuneatus are dorsal column structures carrying proprioception and vibration, which are preserved. The lateral corticospinal tract carries motor fibers and would lead to weakness or spasticity if involved. The dorsal horn contains second-order neurons but not the decussating fibers directly."

    "question": "A patient with a cervical spinal cord lesion exhibits right-sided loss of proprioception and vibration, left-sided loss of pain and temperature sensation below the lesion, and right-sided upper motor neuron weakness. Which of the following best explains this presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Anterior cord syndrome from anterior spinal artery infarct",
      "Brown-Séquard syndrome from hemisection of the spinal cord",
      "Posterior cord syndrome from posterior spinal artery infarct",
      "Syringomyelia causing central cord compression",
      "Cauda equina syndrome with nerve root compression"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of Brown-Séquard syndrome caused by hemisection of the spinal cord. The corticospinal tract and dorsal columns are damaged ipsilaterally, resulting in motor loss and vibration/proprioception deficits on the same side. The spinothalamic tract crosses in the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, leading to contralateral pain and temperature loss. Anterior cord syndrome would affect bilateral motor and spinothalamic pathways. Posterior cord syndrome would spare motor and pain/temp pathways. Syringomyelia presents with bilateral pain/temp loss in a cape distribution. Cauda equina syndrome is a lower motor neuron process and presents differently."

    "question": "A 4-month-old infant presents with progressive macrocephaly and irritability. Imaging shows dilated lateral and third ventricles, while the fourth ventricle appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid",
      "Obstruction of the foramen of Magendie",
      "Impaired CSF absorption by arachnoid granulations",
      "Obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct",
      "Thinning of the arachnoid mater"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, which connects the third to the fourth ventricle, is a common cause of non-communicating hydrocephalus. This results in dilation of the lateral and third ventricles with a normal fourth ventricle. Overproduction of CSF is rare and not a common cause of hydrocephalus. Obstruction of the foramen of Magendie would cause fourth ventricular dilation. Impaired absorption by arachnoid granulations would result in communicating hydrocephalus, affecting all ventricles. Thinning of the arachnoid mater is not a recognized cause of hydrocephalus."

  {
    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents with progressive gait instability, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline. Imaging reveals enlarged ventricles with normal opening pressure on lumbar puncture. Which of the following best explains this patient's condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Obstruction of the interventricular foramina",
      "Increased CSF production by the choroid plexus",
      "Arachnoid granulation dysfunction",
      "Blocked foramina of Luschka and Magendie",
      "Decreased venous drainage from dural sinuses"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This presentation is characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which often results from impaired CSF absorption by the arachnoid granulations. Classic symptoms are gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia. Obstruction of the foramina of Luschka and Magendie causes obstructive hydrocephalus. Obstruction of the interventricular foramina would dilate only the lateral ventricles. Increased CSF production is not the typical mechanism of NPH. Venous drainage impairment can increase intracranial pressure but is not directly responsible for NPH."

    "question": "A neuroanatomy dissection reveals a thin-walled structure extending from the third to the fourth ventricle in the dorsal midbrain. Which of the following accurately describes this structure's role in cerebrospinal fluid circulation?",
    "choices": [
      "It filters CSF from the subarachnoid space into venous sinuses",
      "It allows CSF to flow from the lateral ventricles into the third ventricle",
      "It produces CSF using fenestrated capillaries and ependymal cells",
      "It permits CSF passage between the third and fourth ventricles",
      "It drains CSF from the spinal cord to the cerebellomedullary cistern"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The cerebral aqueduct connects the third and fourth ventricles, permitting CSF to flow between them. It is a narrow channel within the dorsal midbrain and a common site for obstruction in hydrocephalus. CSF filtration into venous sinuses occurs at arachnoid granulations. Flow from the lateral to third ventricles occurs via the interventricular foramina. CSF production occurs primarily at the choroid plexus. Drainage from the spinal cord involves the central canal, not the aqueduct."

    "question": "A 66-year-old woman is found lethargic with a sudden severe headache. CT reveals subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured aneurysm. An external ventricular drain (EVD) is placed, and her opening pressure is 40 mmHg. What is the primary mechanism of increased intracranial pressure in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid by the choroid plexus",
      "Obstruction at the cerebral aqueduct causing non-communicating hydrocephalus",
      "Decreased CSF reabsorption at the arachnoid granulations",
      "Tumor mass effect compressing the ventricles",
      "Cerebral venous thrombosis reducing CSF drainage"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "In subarachnoid hemorrhage, blood disrupts CSF reabsorption by damaging the arachnoid granulations, leading to communicating hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. Overproduction of CSF is rare and not the mechanism in this case. Obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct would cause non-communicating hydrocephalus, not consistent with SAH findings. A tumor mass effect would be seen on imaging and isn't mentioned. Cerebral venous thrombosis can raise ICP but is not related to this mechanism post-SAH."

    "question": "A 28-year-old obese woman presents with daily headaches and transient vision loss. Fundoscopy reveals papilledema. MRI shows small slit-like ventricles. Lumbar puncture shows an elevated opening pressure. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus",
      "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension",
      "Obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis",
      "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis",
      "Bacterial meningitis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) commonly presents in obese young women with headache, visual symptoms, papilledema, and elevated CSF pressure with normal imaging other than small ventricles. Normal pressure hydrocephalus presents in the elderly with gait disturbance, incontinence, and dementia. Obstructive hydrocephalus involves ventricular enlargement, not slit ventricles. Cerebral venous thrombosis may elevate ICP but usually shows abnormal imaging findings. Bacterial meningitis presents with systemic signs and CSF pleocytosis, not isolated ICP elevation."

    "question": "A 73-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of gait instability, urinary incontinence, and progressive memory loss. MRI shows enlarged ventricles without sulcal effacement. Lumbar puncture reveals normal opening pressure, and a high-volume CSF tap temporarily improves symptoms. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Endoscopic third ventriculostomy",
      "Acetazolamide therapy",
      "Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement",
      "Oral corticosteroids",
      "Serial lumbar punctures"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient has classic signs of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH): gait instability, dementia, and urinary incontinence. MRI shows ventriculomegaly, and improvement after high-volume tap confirms the diagnosis. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is the definitive treatment. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy is used for obstructive hydrocephalus. Acetazolamide reduces CSF production but is not used for NPH. Corticosteroids are not effective. Serial LPs are not a long-term solution and are used diagnostically."

    "question": "A 61-year-old man presents with right-sided hemiparesis and a spastic gait. Neurological examination reveals increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign on the right. Which of the following is the most likely site of the lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Right anterior horn of the cervical spinal cord",
      "Left internal capsule",
      "Right pyramids of the medulla",
      "Right ventral root at C7",
      "Left dorsal horn of the spinal cord"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient has upper motor neuron (UMN) signs including spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign, all on the right. The corticospinal tract decussates in the caudal medulla, so a lesion above this level (e.g., in the left internal capsule) would affect the contralateral body. The anterior horn and ventral root lesions would cause lower motor neuron (LMN) signs like flaccid paralysis. The dorsal horn contains sensory neurons. The right pyramids would cause left-sided deficits."

  {
    "question": "A patient presents with flaccid paralysis and muscle atrophy in the left upper limb following poliovirus infection. Which of the following structures is most likely damaged?",
    "choices": [
      "Left corticospinal tract in the internal capsule",
      "Right anterior horn of the cervical spinal cord",
      "Left anterior horn of the cervical spinal cord",
      "Left dorsal columns of the spinal cord",
      "Right lateral corticospinal tract"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Poliovirus primarily targets lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, leading to flaccid paralysis and atrophy. A lesion on the left side would affect the ipsilateral limb. The corticospinal tract is part of the UMN system and causes spasticity when damaged. The dorsal columns carry sensory information. The right lateral corticospinal tract affects the left side below the level of the lesion."

    "question": "A 23-year-old man suffers a penetrating injury to the lateral corticospinal tract at T10. Which of the following clinical findings is most likely?",
    "choices": [
      "Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the left leg",
      "Spastic paralysis of the left leg",
      "Flaccid paralysis of the right leg",
      "Loss of vibration and proprioception in both legs",
      "Facial droop on the right side"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The lateral corticospinal tract carries UMN fibers that decussate in the medullary pyramids. A lesion at T10 on the left would cause spastic paralysis in the ipsilateral (left) leg. Pain and temperature sensation is carried by the spinothalamic tract, which crosses at the level of spinal entry, so would be affected contralaterally. Flaccid paralysis indicates LMN damage. Vibration and proprioception are carried by the dorsal columns. Facial droop would result from cranial nerve or corticobulbar tract involvement, not spinal injury."

    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents with fluctuating muscle weakness, most notably with diplopia and difficulty swallowing that worsens throughout the day. Physical examination reveals ptosis that improves after application of an ice pack. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic terminal",
      "Autoimmune destruction of skeletal muscle sarcolemma",
      "Antibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors",
      "Destruction of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord",
      "Demyelination of peripheral nerves"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient has myasthenia gravis, which is caused by autoantibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This results in fluctuating weakness, particularly in ocular and bulbar muscles, that worsens with activity. The ice pack test improves ptosis by decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity. Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels are associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Skeletal muscle sarcolemma destruction occurs in dystrophinopathies. Anterior horn cell destruction occurs in motor neuron diseases like ALS. Demyelination is characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents with difficulty rising from a chair and combing his hair. Physical examination reveals symmetric proximal muscle weakness. Laboratory studies show elevated creatine kinase and anti-signal recognition particle (anti-SRP) antibodies. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Myasthenia gravis",
      "Polymyositis",
      "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
      "Lambert-Eaton syndrome",
      "Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy presents with subacute onset of symmetric proximal muscle weakness and markedly elevated creatine kinase. Anti-SRP antibodies are a specific finding. Myasthenia gravis typically affects ocular and bulbar muscles and has normal CK. Polymyositis may present similarly but involves endomysial inflammation and CD8+ T cells. Duchenne muscular dystrophy presents in childhood and involves dystrophin mutations. Lambert-Eaton syndrome involves weakness that improves with activity and is associated with small cell lung cancer."

    "question": "A 61-year-old woman with lung cancer presents with progressive proximal muscle weakness. Physical exam shows diminished deep tendon reflexes, which improve after brief exercise. EMG reveals incremental response with repetitive nerve stimulation. Which of the following best describes the underlying pathophysiology?",
    "choices": [
      "Presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release",
      "Postsynaptic receptor blockade by autoantibodies",
      "Autoimmune destruction of peripheral nerves",
      "Decreased presynaptic calcium influx due to autoantibodies",
      "Degeneration of lower motor neurons"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is caused by antibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to impaired acetylcholine release. The hallmark is proximal weakness and diminished reflexes that improve with exercise, and EMG shows incremental response. Postsynaptic receptor blockade occurs in myasthenia gravis. Autoimmune destruction of peripheral nerves describes conditions like Guillain-Barré. Degeneration of LMNs occurs in diseases like spinal muscular atrophy."

    "question": "A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a high-speed motor vehicle accident. He briefly loses consciousness, then becomes lucid, followed by rapid neurological decline. CT scan reveals a lens-shaped hyperdense collection. Which of the following vessels is most likely injured?",
    "choices": [
      "Bridging veins",
      "Middle meningeal artery",
      "Anterior cerebral artery",
      "Superior sagittal sinus",
      "Cortical veins"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of an epidural hematoma, which commonly results from rupture of the middle meningeal artery following a temporal bone fracture. The lens-shaped (biconvex) hyperdense appearance on CT is characteristic. Bridging veins cause subdural hematomas. The anterior cerebral artery and cortical veins are intraparenchymal and do not cause epidural collections. The superior sagittal sinus is venous and not typically involved in trauma-induced epidural bleeding."

    "question": "A 70-year-old woman presents with confusion and right-sided hemiparesis after a minor fall. CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdensity crossing suture lines. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Tear of middle meningeal artery",
      "Tear of bridging veins between the cortex and dura",
      "Rupture of berry aneurysm in the circle of Willis",
      "Shearing injury of the corpus callosum",
      "Contusion of the cerebral cortex"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient has a subdural hematoma, indicated by the crescent-shaped collection that crosses suture lines. It is usually caused by tearing of bridging veins, especially in elderly patients where cerebral atrophy increases tension on these veins. Middle meningeal artery rupture causes epidural hematoma. Berry aneurysm rupture results in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Shearing injury is related to diffuse axonal injury. Cortical contusion causes intraparenchymal hemorrhage."

  {
    "question": "A patient with severe traumatic brain injury is noted to have bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations. CT reveals compression of the basilar cisterns and evidence of transtentorial herniation. Which of the following is the best explanation for these findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Cerebral infarction from embolic stroke",
      "Hydrocephalus from aqueductal stenosis",
      "Increased intracranial pressure triggering Cushing's reflex",
      "Posterior cerebral artery infarction from aneurysm rupture",
      "Subdural hematoma expanding across the midline"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The triad of bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular breathing is Cushing’s triad, a physiologic response to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) that threatens cerebral perfusion. Compression of the basilar cisterns and herniation further support elevated ICP. Embolic stroke, aqueductal stenosis, and PCA aneurysm rupture would not typically present with this triad. A subdural hematoma may cause midline shift but not necessarily Cushing's response unless ICP is markedly elevated."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with progressive bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. He is diagnosed with Parkinson disease. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology behind this patient's reduced movement initiation?",
    "choices": [
      "Degeneration of GABAergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus",
      "Loss of cholinergic input from the basal forebrain",
      "Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta",
      "Destruction of glutamatergic neurons projecting from the thalamus",
      "Hyperactivity of the striatal D1 pathway due to excess dopamine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Parkinson disease is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which leads to reduced stimulation of the direct (D1) pathway and less inhibition of the indirect (D2) pathway. This results in overactivity of GPi and increased inhibition of the thalamus, thereby reducing motor cortex activation. GABAergic degeneration in the STN leads to hemiballismus. Loss of cholinergic input is linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Destruction of glutamatergic thalamic neurons would cause widespread motor depression, but this is not the mechanism in Parkinson’s. Excess dopamine would increase movement, not decrease it."

    "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents with progressive involuntary, dance-like movements. MRI reveals enlarged lateral ventricles. Genetic testing confirms a trinucleotide repeat expansion. Which of the following neural pathways is most directly affected in this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Striatum to globus pallidus externus (GPe)",
      "Subthalamic nucleus to globus pallidus internus (GPi)",
      "Substantia nigra pars compacta to caudate",
      "Thalamus to motor cortex",
      "Globus pallidus internus to thalamus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Huntington disease primarily involves degeneration of the indirect pathway, particularly the GABAergic projections from the striatum to the GPe. This reduces inhibition of the GPe, leading to suppression of the STN and reduced activation of GPi, resulting in decreased thalamic inhibition and hyperkinetic movements. The STN-GPi pathway is spared early. Nigrostriatal degeneration is characteristic of Parkinson's. The thalamus to motor cortex and GPi to thalamus connections are not the primary early sites of pathology in Huntington disease."

    "question": "A 58-year-old man presents with sudden onset of violent, flinging movements of his left arm and leg. Neurological exam confirms hemiballismus. A CT scan is most likely to reveal a lesion in which of the following locations?",
    "choices": [
      "Right substantia nigra pars compacta",
      "Left caudate nucleus",
      "Right subthalamic nucleus",
      "Right internal capsule",
      "Left red nucleus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Hemiballismus is classically caused by a lesion in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus, which disinhibits the thalamus by reducing excitation of the GPi. This leads to excessive movement. The right STN lesion results in left-sided hemiballismus. The substantia nigra is associated with Parkinson disease. Caudate lesions affect behavior and cognition in addition to movement. Internal capsule lesions cause contralateral motor and sensory deficits but not typically hemiballismus. Red nucleus lesions result in midbrain syndromes but do not cause flinging movements."

      "Left middle cerebral artery",
      "Right posterior cerebral artery",
      "Left anterior choroidal artery",
      "Left superior cerebellar artery"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This presentation is classic for a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, which supplies the lateral surface of the cerebral cortex including motor and sensory areas of the face and upper extremity. It also typically affects language centers in the dominant hemisphere (usually left). The anterior cerebral artery would affect the lower limb more than face and arm. Posterior cerebral artery infarcts affect vision and midbrain structures. Anterior choroidal infarcts impact deep structures but rarely cause cortical aphasia. The superior cerebellar artery affects the cerebellum, leading to ataxia rather than cortical deficits."

      "Right anterior cerebral artery",
      "Left anterior cerebral artery",
      "Right posterior cerebral artery",
      "Left vertebral artery"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) supplies the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, including the paracentral lobule which controls lower limb motor function and bladder control. A right ACA infarct would cause left leg weakness and possibly incontinence. The MCA would affect face and arm more prominently. The posterior cerebral artery supplies occipital and inferomedial temporal lobes. The vertebral artery supplies the brainstem and cerebellum, not the cerebral cortex."

      "Right posterior cerebral artery",
      "Left posterior cerebral artery",
      "Right middle cerebral artery",
      "Right superior cerebellar artery"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) supplies the occipital lobe, which is responsible for visual processing. Infarction here can lead to contralateral homonymous hemianopia. A right PCA infarct would cause left visual field loss in both eyes. The anterior and middle cerebral arteries do not supply the occipital cortex. The superior cerebellar artery supplies the cerebellum and upper brainstem, not the visual cortex."

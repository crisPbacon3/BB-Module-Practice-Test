    "question": "A 68-year-old man presents with a 2-year history of progressive bradykinesia, resting tremor in his right hand, and postural instability. Neurological examination reveals masked facies, decreased arm swing, and cogwheel rigidity. He is started on carbidopa-levodopa therapy, which initially improves his symptoms. However, 6 years later, he develops involuntary, dance-like movements in his limbs, especially when the medication is at peak effectiveness. What is the most likely cause of his new symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Disease progression causing worsening of bradykinesia",
      "Exaggerated dopaminergic stimulation from peak levodopa levels",
      "Development of multiple system atrophy",
      "Underlying Huntington's disease",
      "Co-administration of a COMT inhibitor"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient has developed levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), which occurs due to exaggerated dopaminergic stimulation, especially when plasma levodopa concentrations are at their peak. Dyskinesia often manifests as involuntary writhing or choreiform movements and is a common complication in advanced Parkinson’s disease treated with dopaminergic therapy. A is incorrect—disease progression worsens rigidity and bradykinesia, not dyskinesia. C is incorrect—multiple system atrophy is characterized by poor levodopa response and autonomic dysfunction. D is incorrect—Huntington’s disease has earlier onset and genetic etiology. E is incorrect—COMT inhibitors extend levodopa's half-life but do not directly cause dyskinesias."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman develops involuntary, slow, writhing movements of her hands and face 3 weeks after recovering from a sore throat. Physical exam shows no rigidity or bradykinesia. MRI is normal. Labs are negative for copper metabolism defects. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Huntington’s disease",
      "Sydenham’s chorea",
      "Wilson’s disease",
      "Essential tremor",
      "Dystonia"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Sydenham’s chorea is an autoimmune post-streptococcal complication, typically occurring in children and adolescents, characterized by rapid, irregular, purposeless movements that may present weeks to months after a Group A streptococcal infection. A is incorrect—Huntington’s chorea has autosomal dominant inheritance and psychiatric features, typically in the fourth decade. C is incorrect—Wilson’s disease presents with hepatic, psychiatric, and neurologic symptoms, and is diagnosed by low ceruloplasmin and high urinary copper. D is incorrect—essential tremor is action-related, not choreiform. E is incorrect—dystonia involves sustained, twisting postures rather than rapid movements."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man with schizophrenia presents with involuntary facial grimacing, tongue protrusion, and lip smacking. He has been on haloperidol for the past 4 years. Examination shows repetitive, purposeless oral movements. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism?",
    "choices": [
      "Decreased GABAergic output from the striatum",
      "Progressive neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra",
      "Autoimmune destruction of the subthalamic nucleus",
      "Dopamine receptor supersensitivity",
      "Accumulation of copper in basal ganglia"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Tardive dyskinesia results from long-term dopamine receptor blockade (e.g., antipsychotics), leading to upregulation and hypersensitivity of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia. This manifests as involuntary, repetitive movements, particularly in the oral-buccal-lingual region. A is incorrect—this is a feature of Huntington’s disease. B is incorrect—seen in Parkinson’s disease. C is incorrect—associated with hemiballismus. E is incorrect—relevant in Wilson’s disease."

    "question": "A 61-year-old man presents with a 3-year history of resting tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Postmortem examination reveals depigmentation of the substantia nigra and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in neurons that stain positive for alpha-synuclein. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiologic mechanism of this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Loss of upper and lower motor neurons with Bunina bodies",
      "Trinucleotide repeat expansion causing caudate degeneration",
      "Abnormal protein aggregation disrupting ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways",
      "Impaired DNA repair due to ATM gene mutation",
      "Excessive copper accumulation due to ATP7B mutation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient's findings are classic for idiopathic Parkinson disease. Alpha-synuclein misfolds and aggregates into Lewy bodies and neurites, disrupting neuronal degradation pathways including the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosomal-autophagy systems. Choice 1 describes ALS. Choice 2 is Huntington disease. Choice 4 describes ataxia-telangiectasia. Choice 5 refers to Wilson disease."

Genetic analysis confirms CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 4. Which of the following best explains the mechanism of this disease?",
    "choices": [
      "Toxic gain of function from mutant huntingtin protein",
      "Copper accumulation in basal ganglia due to transport defect",
      "Loss of alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord",
      "Failure of bilirubin conjugation in hepatocytes",
      "Deposition of alpha-synuclein in cortical neurons"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Huntington disease is caused by a toxic gain of function from an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene, leading to formation of mutant huntingtin protein aggregates. Choice 1 is correct. Choice 2 describes Wilson disease. Choice 3 refers to ALS. Choice 4 pertains to kernicterus. Choice 5 is seen in dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson disease."

    "question": "A 63-year-old woman presents with progressive weakness in her hands and legs, spasticity in the lower extremities, and difficulty speaking. Examination shows tongue fasciculations, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign. MRI shows corticospinal tract hyperintensity. Which of the following histopathologic findings is most specific to this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Atrophy of caudate nucleus and boxcar ventricles",
      "Lewy bodies in substantia nigra",
      "Bunina bodies in anterior horn cells",
      "Copper deposits in lenticular nucleus",
      "Bilirubin deposition in cerebellum and medulla"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient's mixed upper and lower motor neuron findings are characteristic of ALS. Bunina bodies, composed of TDP-43, are a specific histologic finding in surviving anterior horn neurons. Choice 1 is Huntington disease. Choice 2 is Parkinson disease. Choice 4 is Wilson disease. Choice 5 is kernicterus."

    "question": "A 72-year-old woman presents with a 2-year history of memory loss and difficulty managing her finances. Neurologic exam shows no focal deficits. Cognitive testing reveals poor delayed recall and impaired executive function. CSF analysis shows decreased amyloid-β42 and increased phosphorylated tau. Which of the following brain structures is most directly associated with early pathologic changes in this disease?",
    "choices": [
      "Subthalamic nucleus",
      "Basal nucleus of Meynert",
      "Amygdala",
      "Cerebellar vermis",
      "Red nucleus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Alzheimer’s disease typically begins with degeneration of the basal nucleus of Meynert, which provides widespread cholinergic input to the cortex. This structure is one of the earliest affected in AD and is linked to impaired attention and memory. The subthalamic nucleus is affected in hemiballismus. The amygdala may be affected later but is not the earliest site. The cerebellar vermis is involved in truncal coordination. The red nucleus is involved in motor control and not primarily affected in Alzheimer’s disease."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with progressive visual hallucinations, fluctuating attention, and recent development of parkinsonian gait. His symptoms began with cognitive changes prior to the motor findings. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen on histopathologic examination?",
    "choices": [
      "Intracytoplasmic inclusions positive for alpha-synuclein in cortical neurons",
      "Periventricular plaques and tangles with demyelination",
      "Ballooned neurons with tau accumulation in frontal cortex",
      "Spongiform changes with 14-3-3 protein in CSF",
      "Neurofibrillary tangles in hippocampal neurons"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "This patient has dementia with Lewy bodies, characterized by early cognitive changes, visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, and later parkinsonism. The hallmark histology is cortical Lewy bodies composed of alpha-synuclein. Option 1 is correct. Option 2 describes multiple sclerosis. Option 3 is seen in frontotemporal dementia. Option 4 is characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Option 5 is associated with Alzheimer’s disease."

  {
    "question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents with a stepwise decline in memory and executive function. MRI reveals multiple small infarcts in the deep white matter. Which of the following treatment strategies is most appropriate to reduce further cognitive decline in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Memantine and donepezil",
      "Tight glycemic and blood pressure control",
      "Monoclonal antibody therapy targeting amyloid",
      "Dopaminergic agents and physical therapy",
      "Low-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation and imaging are consistent with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), a type of dementia caused by cerebrovascular disease. The mainstay of treatment is addressing modifiable vascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Memantine and donepezil may be helpful in mixed dementia but are not first-line for pure vascular dementia. Monoclonal antibodies target amyloid and are used in early Alzheimer’s disease. Dopaminergic therapy is used for Parkinson’s. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are used in inflammatory or autoimmune conditions."

    "question": "A 29-year-old man suffers a traumatic brain injury resulting in bilateral medial temporal lobe damage. He is unable to form new episodic memories but can still learn new motor tasks like riding a bicycle. Which of the following types of memory is most likely preserved in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Episodic memory",
      "Semantic memory",
      "Working memory",
      "Procedural memory",
      "Explicit memory"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario is consistent with anterograde amnesia due to medial temporal lobe damage, as famously seen in patient H.M. Procedural memory, which involves skills and habits and is mediated by the striatum and cerebellum, remains intact. Episodic and semantic memory are types of explicit memory, which are impaired. Working memory depends on the prefrontal cortex and may be spared but is distinct from procedural memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "A 67-year-old woman with early Alzheimer’s disease shows impaired recent memory but can still recall distant events. Which brain region is most associated with this memory gradient?",
    "choices": [
      "Basolateral amygdala",
      "Prefrontal cortex",
      "Hippocampus and adjacent temporal cortex",
      "Striatum and thalamus",
      "Cerebellum"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Alzheimer’s disease preferentially affects the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal structures, which are essential for encoding and consolidating new memories. This leads to an anterograde and temporally graded retrograde amnesia, with recent memories more affected. The basolateral amygdala modulates emotional memory. The striatum and cerebellum mediate procedural learning. The prefrontal cortex is more important in working memory and executive function."
  },
  {
    "question": "A 60-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease is asked to perform a probabilistic card prediction task. He fails to learn the card-outcome associations, though he remembers the details of the task. Which of the following best explains his difficulty with the task?",
    "choices": [
      "Hippocampal dysfunction due to dopaminergic depletion",
      "Impairment of amygdala-dependent emotional learning",
      "Lesion of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex affecting working memory",
      "Damage to the striatum impairing implicit learning",
      "Cortical atrophy impairing semantic knowledge"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Patients with Parkinson’s disease have degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the striatum, which is essential for implicit learning tasks like probabilistic classification. Unlike amnesics, Parkinson’s patients typically have intact declarative memory. The hippocampus, amygdala, and cortical areas are not primarily responsible for this specific type of procedural learning."

  {
    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with a resting tremor in his right hand, difficulty initiating movement, and a stooped posture. Neurological examination reveals bradykinesia, rigidity, and a masked facial expression. The tremor improves with purposeful movement. Levodopa therapy is initiated with excellent symptom control. Over the next few years, he develops involuntary, writhing movements of his limbs, especially during peak medication efficacy. Which of the following best explains this new symptom?",
    "choices": [
      "Progression of Parkinson’s disease",
      "Excess dopamine in the striatum",
      "Neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra",
      "Blockade of dopamine receptors",
      "Withdrawal of dopamine agonists"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient developed levodopa-induced dyskinesias, which are involuntary movements due to peak-dose dopamine levels exceeding the therapeutic window. This is a classic complication in Parkinson's disease patients treated with levodopa over time. Progression of PD and degeneration of the substantia nigra are central to the disease itself but do not directly cause dyskinesias. Dopamine receptor blockade would cause parkinsonism, not dyskinesia. Withdrawal of agonists might cause 'off' symptoms, not hyperkinesia."
  },
  {
    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents with involuntary flinging movements of her left arm that started suddenly. Neurologic exam confirms large amplitude, proximal, violent, irregular movements. MRI reveals a small lesion in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of her symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Loss of GABAergic inhibition in the caudate",
      "Increased dopaminergic activity in the striatum",
      "Disinhibition of the thalamus via globus pallidus internus",
      "Damage to cerebellar Purkinje cells",
      "Decreased cortical output from the premotor cortex"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical description is consistent with hemiballismus, classically caused by lesions of the contralateral subthalamic nucleus, which leads to decreased excitation of the GPi. The result is reduced inhibition of the thalamus, promoting excessive, involuntary movement. GABAergic loss in the caudate is more associated with Huntington’s disease. Dopamine excess can cause chorea but not hemiballismus. Cerebellar damage causes ataxia, not flinging movements. Cortical output loss would lead to paresis or apraxia, not hyperkinesia."

  {
    "question": "A 10-year-old girl presents with involuntary, irregular, purposeless movements involving her limbs and face. Her parents note she has had recent emotional lability and clumsiness. History reveals a sore throat 2 months ago. On exam, there is milkmaid grip and darting tongue movements. What is the most appropriate next diagnostic step?",
    "choices": [
      "Serum ceruloplasmin",
      "MRI of the brain",
      "Throat culture",
      "Antistreptolysin O titer",
      "Genetic testing for trinucleotide repeats"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The girl’s symptoms are classic for Sydenham’s chorea, a post-streptococcal autoimmune movement disorder associated with acute rheumatic fever. ASO titers help confirm recent group A Streptococcus infection. Ceruloplasmin is used for Wilson’s disease, MRI may be used but is not first line here, throat culture is not useful weeks after infection, and trinucleotide testing is for Huntington's disease, which presents later in life."

  {
    "question": "A 55-year-old man exhibits socially inappropriate behavior, compulsive overeating, and apathy. Over the next two years, he develops expressive aphasia and impaired comprehension. MRI reveals frontal and anterior temporal lobe atrophy. Which of the following is the most likely histopathologic hallmark of his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Lewy bodies positive for alpha-synuclein",
      "Neuritic plaques composed of beta-amyloid",
      "Pick bodies positive for hyperphosphorylated tau",
      "Spongiform changes with no inflammation",
      "Perivascular tau accumulation at depths of cortical sulci"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of frontotemporal dementia (Pick's disease), characterized by early behavioral disinhibition and language deficits. The most specific histopathologic hallmark is the presence of Pick bodies, which are round intracytoplasmic inclusions containing hyperphosphorylated tau. Lewy bodies (choice A) are associated with dementia with Lewy bodies. Neuritic plaques (choice B) are characteristic of Alzheimer disease. Spongiform changes (choice D) are typical of prion diseases. Perivascular tau (choice E) is found in chronic traumatic encephalopathy."
  },
  {
    "question": "A 68-year-old woman has progressive cognitive decline characterized by memory loss and executive dysfunction. Imaging shows diffuse cerebral atrophy, predominantly in the temporal and parietal lobes. Histology reveals neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Which biomarker pattern is most supportive of her diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "CSF Aβ42 low, CSF tau low",
      "CSF Aβ42 high, CSF p-tau low",
      "CSF Aβ42 low, CSF p-tau high",
      "CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio high, CSF p-tau low",
      "Normal CSF Aβ42 and tau levels"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The combination of low CSF Aβ42 and elevated phosphorylated tau (p-tau) is the most supportive biomarker profile for Alzheimer disease. Low Aβ42 indicates amyloid plaque accumulation, while high p-tau reflects neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Choices A and B are inconsistent with Alzheimer pathology. A high Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (choice D) suggests normal amyloid metabolism. Normal biomarkers (choice E) would not support the diagnosis in a symptomatic individual."

  {
    "question": "A 70-year-old man with poorly controlled hypertension presents with sudden-onset confusion and memory impairment following a recent stroke. Neuroimaging reveals multiple small infarcts in the subcortical white matter and basal ganglia. What is the most likely mechanism underlying his cognitive impairment?",
    "choices": [
      "Perivascular deposition of amyloid beta",
      "Cortical spongiform degeneration",
      "Strategic infarction of hippocampus and thalamus",
      "Lacunar infarcts and white matter axonal degeneration",
      "TDP43-positive neuronal inclusions"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has subcortical vascular dementia due to small vessel disease. The typical mechanism is lacunar infarcts and diffuse white matter axonal damage affecting connectivity between brain regions. Amyloid deposition (choice A) is characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Spongiform changes (choice B) are seen in prion disease. Strategic infarcts (choice C) cause cortical vascular dementia. TDP43 inclusions (choice E) are associated with frontotemporal dementia and ALS."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents with episodes of transient left-sided numbness lasting 30 minutes to an hour. MRI-DWI shows no acute infarct. Which of the following most accurately describes the current definition of his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Cerebral ischemia lasting less than 24 hours with imaging evidence of infarction",
      "Neurologic symptoms from ischemia lasting less than 1 hour without infarction",
      "Transient symptoms due to hemorrhagic stroke",
      "Recurrent seizures presenting as focal neurologic deficits",
      "Cerebral dysfunction from embolic infarct with rapid recovery"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The modern definition of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) includes neurological symptoms of presumed ischemic origin lasting less than 1 hour and no evidence of infarction on imaging. The older definition used a 24-hour time limit but is now replaced to account for MRI findings. Choices 1 and 5 incorrectly imply infarction. Choice 3 is a hemorrhagic event, and choice 4 describes seizure-related symptoms."
  },
  {
    "question": "A 70-year-old man with hypertension presents with sudden-onset right hemiparesis and aphasia. Noncontrast CT rules out hemorrhage. IV tPA is administered 2 hours after symptom onset. What is the primary therapeutic target of tPA in this setting?",
    "choices": [
      "Neurons in the ischemic core",
      "Restoring perfusion to the ischemic penumbra",
      "Reducing long-term atherosclerosis",
      "Preventing hemorrhagic transformation",
      "Lowering systemic blood pressure acutely"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The ischemic penumbra is the area of brain tissue that is functionally impaired but structurally viable. The goal of IV tPA is to restore perfusion to this region and salvage brain tissue. The core is already infarcted and not recoverable (choice 0). tPA does not reduce atherosclerosis or acutely prevent hemorrhagic transformation (choices 2 and 3). BP lowering (choice 4) is done cautiously and is not the goal of tPA administration."

    "question": "A 58-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation presents with left-sided weakness and right gaze deviation. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 20. CT angiogram reveals a proximal right MCA occlusion. She receives IV tPA at 90 minutes and is transferred for endovascular therapy. What feature most strongly supports her eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy?",
    "choices": [
      "NIHSS score above 10",
      "Any proximal MCA occlusion within 24 hours",
      "Large vessel occlusion with favorable collateral circulation",
      "History of atrial fibrillation",
      "Absence of hemorrhage on CT"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated in patients with large vessel occlusion (like MCA M1) and favorable imaging findings, particularly good collateral circulation or a large mismatch on perfusion imaging. NIHSS >10 (choice 0) suggests severity but is not sufficient alone. Atrial fibrillation (choice 3) increases stroke risk but does not determine thrombectomy eligibility. CT without hemorrhage (choice 4) is needed for tPA, not thrombectomy specifically."

    "question": "A 68-year-old man presents with sudden-onset right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia. Non-contrast CT scan is negative for hemorrhage. He is given tPA within 3 hours of symptom onset. An MRI later shows a left-sided infarct in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery. Which of the following pathologic processes most likely underlies the damage seen in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Atherosclerotic occlusion of lenticulostriate arteries",
      "Amyloid deposition in cortical vessels",
      "Thromboembolic occlusion of a large artery",
      "Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm rupture",
      "Fibrinoid necrosis of penetrating arterioles"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient presents with symptoms of a large-vessel stroke involving the MCA, consistent with a thromboembolic event. This type of stroke commonly results from emboli originating in the heart or large arteries. Choice 0 describes small vessel disease leading to lacunar strokes. Choice 1 is associated with lobar hemorrhages, not infarction. Choice 3 involves hemorrhagic strokes due to microaneurysm rupture. Choice 4 is seen in malignant hypertension leading to hemorrhage."

CT scan shows blood in the basal cisterns and ventricles. Which of the following underlying vascular abnormalities is most likely responsible?",
    "choices": [
      "Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm",
      "Arteriovenous malformation",
      "Saccular aneurysm at a branch point of the Circle of Willis",
      "Fibrinoid necrosis of penetrating arteries",
      "Atherosclerotic occlusion of internal carotid artery"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This presentation is classic for subarachnoid hemorrhage, most commonly due to rupture of a saccular (Berry) aneurysm at branch points of the Circle of Willis. Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms (choice 0) lead to deep intraparenchymal hemorrhage. AVMs (choice 1) are less common causes. Fibrinoid necrosis (choice 3) and atherosclerosis (choice 4) are more associated with hypertensive or ischemic strokes respectively."

      "Arteriolosclerosis with lipohyalinosis in deep penetrating arteries",
      "Atherosclerotic plaque rupture with distal embolization",
      "Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm rupture",
      "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This is a classic lacunar stroke caused by small vessel disease from chronic hypertension. The characteristic finding is arteriolosclerosis with lipohyalinosis in the small penetrating arteries. Choice 0 describes early ischemic neuron changes but is not specific. Choice 2 describes embolic infarcts. Choice 3 leads to hemorrhagic stroke, and choice 4 causes lobar hemorrhages in the elderly."

      "Midbrain tectum",
      "Diencephalon",
      "Cerebellum",
      "Pons",
      "Medulla oblongata"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The failure of the anterior (rostral) neuropore to close results in anencephaly, a lethal condition marked by the absence of the forebrain. The diencephalon, a derivative of the prosencephalon (forebrain), would be absent. The midbrain (choice 0), pons (choice 3), medulla (choice 4), and cerebellum (choice 2) develop from more caudal regions and would not be affected by anterior neuropore closure failure."

      "Surface ectoderm",
      "Neural crest",
      "Mesoderm",
      "Neural tube",
      "Endoderm"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "A sinus tract with neural elements suggests a dermal sinus resulting from incomplete separation of the cutaneous ectoderm from the neural tube during neurulation. This implicates defective neural tube closure. Surface ectoderm (choice 0) gives rise to skin but does not produce neural tissue. Neural crest (choice 1) contributes to peripheral nerves and melanocytes. Mesoderm (choice 2) gives rise to bone and muscle, and endoderm (choice 4) forms gut lining."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Secondary neurulation forms the most caudal portions of the neural tube, including the sacral and coccygeal spinal cord. High levels of retinoic acid can disrupt this process, leading to caudal regression. The telencephalon (choice 0), mesencephalon (choice 1), myelencephalon (choice 2), and diencephalon (choice 4) all derive from the primary neurulation process and would not be directly affected."

  "choices": [
    "Amyloid plaques and tangles",
    "Caudate atrophy",
    "Lewy bodies",
    "Multiple infarcts",
    "Spongiform change caused by prions"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "This patient has clinical signs of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Key findings include myoclonus (especially triggered by stimuli), ataxia, periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG, and cortical ribboning on MRI. The pathognomonic pathology is spongiform change caused by prion proteins. Amyloid plaques (choice 0) are seen in Alzheimer disease. Caudate atrophy (choice 1) is typical of Huntington disease. Lewy bodies (choice 2) are seen in dementia with Lewy bodies. Multiple infarcts (choice 3) suggest vascular dementia."

  "question": "A 65-year-old male has new-onset hallucinations. His wife notes that, for the past few weeks, he has thrashed around in the bed needing to sleep in a different room. He has become forgetful about appointments and no longer pays bills on time. Physical examination reveals resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Mini-Mental State Examination reveals deficits in memory. The most likely pathologic finding would be:",
  "choices": [
    "Caudate atrophy",
    "Lewy bodies",
    "Multiple infarcts",
    "Plaques and tangles",
    "Selective fronto-temporal atrophy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This patient's combination of visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out dreams), and parkinsonian features is characteristic of dementia with Lewy bodies. The defining pathologic finding is Lewy bodies, which are eosinophilic inclusions composed of alpha-synuclein in cortical neurons. Caudate atrophy (choice 0) is seen in Huntington disease. Multiple infarcts (choice 2) point to vascular dementia. Plaques and tangles (choice 3) are hallmark findings in Alzheimer disease. Selective frontotemporal atrophy (choice 4) is typical of frontotemporal dementia."

  "question": "A 65-year-old male diagnosed with dementia 5 years ago no longer pays bills on time and is noticed wandering about his neighborhood trying to find his home. His neighbors are happy to help him. He dies a year later of pneumonia. Gross examination of brain is likely to reveal:",
  "choices": [
    "Selective fronto-temporal atrophy",
    "Diffuse cerebral atrophy",
    "Pallor of substantia nigra",
    "Atrophy of caudate nucleus",
    "Multiple infarcts"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This patient had progressive dementia with memory loss and functional decline over several years, consistent with Alzheimer disease. The classic gross pathologic finding in Alzheimer disease is diffuse cerebral atrophy, particularly affecting the hippocampus and association cortices. Choice 0 is characteristic of frontotemporal dementia. Choice 2 is typical in Parkinson disease. Choice 3 is seen in Huntington disease. Choice 4 suggests vascular dementia."

  "question": "A 40-year-old man has become increasingly restless over the past 2 years. Recently, he has been making jerky, dancelike movements with his arms and legs and is unable to control his extremities during these episodes. He also has become forgetful with trouble completing tasks. His father had similar symptoms in his sixties and later developed dementia. His CNS is most likely to show:",
  "choices": [
    "Atrophy of caudate nuclei with box-car ventricles",
    "Cerebellar degeneration",
    "Degeneration of anterior horn neurons",
    "Loss of pigmented neurons",
    "Spongiform encephalopathy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "This patient likely has Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea, behavioral changes, and dementia. The hallmark pathology is atrophy of the caudate nucleus, leading to enlargement of the lateral ventricles, often described as 'boxcar ventricles.' Cerebellar degeneration (choice 1) is associated with ataxias. Degeneration of anterior horn neurons (choice 2) is seen in ALS. Loss of pigmented neurons (choice 3) is seen in Parkinson disease. Spongiform encephalopathy (choice 4) is characteristic of prion diseases such as CJD."

  "question": "A 60-year-old previously healthy construction worker has progressive difficulty in holding his tools. Two years later he has weakness of extremities with spasticity, difficulty in walking, speaking and swallowing. On examination, some of the reflexes are reduced, but others are exaggerated. Fasciculations of tongue, as well as Babinski sign are noted. His CNS is most likely to show:",
  "choices": [
    "Atrophy of caudate nuclei with box-car ventricles",
    "Cerebellar degeneration",
    "Degeneration of anterior horn neurons",
    "Loss of pigmented neurons",
    "Spongiform encephalopathy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "This patient's progressive mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs, including spasticity, tongue fasciculations, and Babinski sign, point to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The hallmark pathologic feature of ALS is degeneration of anterior horn neurons (LMNs) and corticospinal tracts (UMNs). Choice 0 corresponds to Huntington disease. Choice 1 refers to cerebellar ataxias. Choice 3 indicates Parkinson disease, and choice 4 is seen in prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."

  "question": "A 78-year-old man is brought because of frequent falls over the past 2 months. Physical examination reveals a shuffling gait, marked rigidity at his knees and elbows, an upper extremity tremor, and bradykinesia on finger-to-nose testing. His muscle strength is intact. Which of the following structures is most likely affected in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Anterior horn neurons",
    "Caudate nuclei",
    "Cerebellum",
    "Hippocampus",
    "Substantia nigra"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "This patient's resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and shuffling gait are classic signs of Parkinson disease. The characteristic pathology involves degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Anterior horn neurons (choice 0) are affected in ALS. Caudate nucleus (choice 1) is involved in Huntington disease. Cerebellar dysfunction (choice 2) causes ataxia rather than rigidity. The hippocampus (choice 3) is primarily involved in Alzheimer disease."

  "question": "A child presents to the clinic with nausea, loss of appetite and epigastric pain worse between meals and at night. The patient is evaluated for Helicobacter pylori infection. A non-invasive laboratory test is considered for the initial work-up that has the highest sensitivity for detection of the pathogen. Which of the following tests would fit these criteria?",
  "choices": [
    "Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)",
    "H&E staining of biopsied gastric mucosa",
    "Helicobacter pylori fecal antigen test",
    "Serologic test for IgG antibodies against H. pylori",
    "Stool culture for isolation of H. pylori"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (nausea, loss of appetite, epigastric pain worse between meals and at night) are classic for Helicobacter pylori infection. The question asks for a non-invasive laboratory test with the highest sensitivity for initial work-up. The Helicobacter pylori fecal antigen test (Option C) is a non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific test for active H. pylori infection. Options A (EGD) and B (H&E staining of biopsy) are invasive procedures, not non-invasive tests. Option D (Serologic test for IgG antibodies) indicates past exposure, not necessarily current active infection, and thus is less useful for initial diagnosis of active infection. Option E (Stool culture) for H. pylori is generally not performed due to difficulty in culturing the organism."

  "question": "A 39-year-old woman presents with a one-week history of abdominal tenderness. Following a physical exam and imaging studies of the abdomen, the physician recommends a surgical procedure and proceeds with obtaining informed consent. When discussing the benefits and risks with the patient, it appears that she may not meet the criteria for capacity. Which of the following must the patient demonstrate in response to open-ended questions that would confirm her ability to make an informed decision?",
  "choices": [
    "Acceptance, acknowledgment, reasoning, understanding",
    "Acceptance, appreciation, expressing a choice, understanding",
    "Acknowledgment, consideration, expressing a choice, reasoning",
    "Appreciation, acknowledgment, expressing a choice, reasoning",
    "Appreciation, expressing a choice, reasoning, understanding"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "To confirm a patient's capacity to make an informed decision, they must demonstrate four key elements, often remembered by the mnemonic 'AREU': Appreciation, Reasoning, Expressing a choice, and Understanding. The patient must be able to: (1) **A**ppreciate the situation and its consequences, (2) **R**eason logically about the information, (3) **E**xpress a clear choice consistently, and (4) **U**nderstand the information provided regarding the procedure, benefits, and risks. Option E encompasses all these essential components. The other options are missing one or more critical elements of capacity."

  "question": "A 54-year-old-old obese woman presents to the Emergency Department for concerns of fever with a T max of 39.2Â°C. The patient has had decreased oral intake of the past 3 days due to worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Acute ascending cholangitis is suspected. Which of the following findings would complete Charcot's cholangitis triad?",
  "choices": [
    "Leukocytosis",
    "Anemia",
    "Jaundice",
    "Headache",
    "Dyspnea"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "Charcot's triad is a classic constellation of symptoms indicating acute ascending cholangitis. It consists of fever, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and jaundice. The patient presents with fever and RUQ abdominal pain. Therefore, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or sclera due to bilirubin buildup) would complete the triad. Leukocytosis (Option A) is a common finding in infection but is not part of Charcot's triad itself. Anemia (Option B), headache (Option D), and dyspnea (Option E) are not components of Charcot's triad for cholangitis."

  "question": "Acute pancreatitis is considered in a 45-year-old man with vomiting and abdominal pain. Which statement about the diagnostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis is accurate?",
  "choices": [
    "Serum amylase is more specific than serum lipase",
    "The sensitivity of CT scan is 100%",
    "The level of serum amylase elevation reflects severity of the disease",
    "Air in the biliary tract on X-ray is a highly sensitive finding",
    "Serum lipase remains elevated longer than serum amylase"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "When evaluating acute pancreatitis, serum lipase is generally preferred over serum amylase because it remains elevated longer (Option E) and is more specific to the pancreas than amylase (Option A is incorrect). While amylase can be elevated in other conditions (e.g., salivary gland disorders, bowel ischemia), lipase is largely specific to the pancreas. CT scan (Option B) is highly sensitive but not 100% sensitive for acute pancreatitis, especially in the early stages. The level of serum amylase or lipase elevation (Option C) does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the disease. Air in the biliary tract on X-ray (Option D) is indicative of a fistula (e.g., gallstone ileus) or previous biliary surgery, not a direct diagnostic finding for acute pancreatitis."

  "question": "A 45-year-old man with a past medical history of moderate intellectual disability presents to the clinic complaining of epigastric abdominal pain, early satiety, episodic vomiting, and nausea. Along the course of his evaluation, he undergoes serologic and histologic testing that results in eventual diagnosis of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Further testing reveals the presence of urease-producing helical-shaped organisms. Staging demonstrates gastric involvement alone without other organ or extranodal involvement. Which initial treatment should be recommended?",
  "choices": [
    "Antimicrobial therapy",
    "Chemotherapy",
    "Immunotherapy",
    "Immunotherapy & Chemotherapy",
    "Radiation therapy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with gastric MALT lymphoma, and further testing reveals the presence of 'urease-producing helical-shaped organisms,' which strongly points to Helicobacter pylori infection. Gastric MALT lymphoma is highly associated with chronic H. pylori infection. For localized gastric MALT lymphoma with H. pylori infection and no other extranodal involvement, the initial treatment is H. pylori eradication therapy (antimicrobial therapy). This often leads to remission of the lymphoma. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy (Options B, C, D, E) are typically reserved for cases where H. pylori eradication fails, or the lymphoma is advanced, aggressive, or not associated with H. pylori."

  "question": "A 58-year-old female patient has been diagnosed with a splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Monotherapy with rituximab infusion weekly x4 weeks, followed by a maintenance infusion every 4 months, gives a complete clinical response with minimal adverse effects. Rituximab binds to both normal and malignant B cells. What feature of its mechanism of action prevents catastrophic depletion of B cells?",
  "choices": [
    "Some normal B cells develop resistance to rituximab through expression of alternative surface antigens.",
    "Early pro-B cells do not express CD-20 to which rituximab binds, allowing replenishment of more mature B cells over time.",
    "Only some B cell lineages express CD-20, and the CD-20-negative lineages are sufficient to provide an adequate immune response.",
    "Natural variants of the IgG Fc receptor that activates NK cell killing are unable to bind rituximab and preserve some normal B cells."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 protein on B cells, leading to their depletion. The reason rituximab therapy does not cause catastrophic and permanent depletion of all B cells is that early progenitor B cells (pro-B cells) in the bone marrow do not express CD20. These early B cell precursors are therefore spared from the drug's effects and can differentiate and mature into CD20-positive B cells, allowing for the replenishment of the B cell population over time after treatment completion. Options A, C, and D do not accurately describe the mechanism by which B cell replenishment occurs or how some normal B cells are preserved during rituximab therapy."

  "question": "A 50-year-old man presents at the Family Medicine Clinic concerned about recurring nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain with a chronic fever. Over time, diagnostic and laboratory tests confirm that the patient has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Treatment regimens are discussed, of which, intravenous rituximab is determined to be the best option. Which of the following is a contraindication?",
  "choices": [
    "Cholecystitis",
    "Hepatitis B",
    "Pulmonary Hypertension",
    "Thrombocytopenia",
    "Type 1 diabetes"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient is being considered for rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. A significant contraindication and major concern for rituximab therapy, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, is Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Rituximab can lead to HBV reactivation, which can cause severe liver inflammation, fulminant hepatitis, liver failure, and even death. Therefore, screening for HBV infection is crucial before initiating rituximab, and prophylactic antiviral therapy is often given if a patient tests positive. Cholecystitis (Option A), Pulmonary Hypertension (Option C), Thrombocytopenia (Option D), and Type 1 Diabetes (Option E) are generally not contraindications to rituximab therapy, although careful monitoring and management of comorbidities are always necessary."

  "question": "Mr. Wilks is a 45-year-old man with cholelithiasis who has been referred to surgery for cholecystectomy. As the surgeon prepares to meet with Mr. Wilks to get his consent for the procedure, the review of the medical record reveals that the patient has schizoaffective disorder and intellectual disability. Which of the following findings would require the surgeon to obtain consent for the procedure from another individual legally responsible for Mr. Wilks' health care decisions?",
  "choices": [
    "An intellectual assessment conducted by a psychologist reveals that Mr. Wilks' I.Q. is 60.",
    "Mr. Wilks' mother has the power of attorney on his behalf.",
    "During the interview, Mr. Wilks had significant difficulty understanding and considering his treatment choices.",
    "On the Mini-Mental Status Exam, Mr. Wilks scores only a 22.",
    "The psychiatric exam report indicates that Mr. Wilks has a history of hallucinations and delusions."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The core issue in obtaining informed consent is the patient's capacity to make medical decisions. While intellectual disability (Option A), a low Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score (Option D), or a history of psychiatric illness like hallucinations/delusions (Option E) may *suggest* impaired capacity, they do not automatically equate to a lack of capacity. The crucial determinant is whether the patient can *demonstrate understanding and reasoning* regarding their specific treatment choices during the interview process. If, during the direct interview, Mr. Wilks had significant difficulty understanding and considering his treatment choices (Option C), this would indicate a lack of capacity for this specific decision, thereby requiring consent from a legally authorized surrogate decision-maker. The mother having power of attorney (Option B) is relevant if capacity is determined to be absent, but it does not *by itself* necessitate surrogate consent without a direct assessment of the patient's current capacity."

  "question": "A 5-year-old girl is diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Her past medical history is significant for 6 episodes of otitis media with S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. She has also had 2 episodes of bacterial sinusitis as well as intermittent diarrhea. Physical exam is significant for crackles in her left upper and middle lobes. Chest x-ray shows bronchiectases in the left upper and middle lobes. Labs reveal Hgb 8.9 g/dL, platelets 102,000/mm^3 and WBC 2800/mm^3. Further work-up shows: IgG 150 mg/dL (normal 768-1728 mg/dL) IgA 0 mg/dL (normal 99-396 mg/dL) IgM 40 mg/dL (normal 38-266 mg/dL) Nitroblue tetrazolium test and measurement of superoxide production yield normal results. Diepoxybutane (DEB) screening for chromosomal breakage in lymphocytes is also normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Fanconi Anemia",
    "Hyper-IgM syndrome",
    "Chronic granulomatous disease",
    "Common variable immunodeficiency",
    "Severe combined immunodeficiency"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's clinical picture includes recurrent bacterial infections (pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis), intermittent diarrhea, bronchiectasis, and cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia). The hallmark lab findings are profoundly low IgG, IgA, and IgM levels. This pattern of recurrent bacterial infections, respiratory tract damage (bronchiectasis), gastrointestinal issues, and panhypogammaglobulinemia, along with normal NBT and DEB tests (ruling out CGD and Fanconi anemia respectively), is classic for Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). Option A (Fanconi Anemia) is incorrect due to normal DEB screening. Option B (Hyper-IgM syndrome) presents with normal or elevated IgM, but low IgG and IgA, which is not the case here (all Igs are low). Option C (Chronic Granulomatous Disease) is ruled out by the normal Nitroblue Tetrazolium test. Option E (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) typically presents in infancy with more severe infections, including opportunistic infections, and profoundly low lymphocyte counts and all immunoglobulin levels, which is not fully consistent with this presentation at age 5 with specific recurrent bacterial infections and bronchiectasis."

  "question": "A 45-year-old man is accompanied by his nursing home caretaker who informs the attending physician that the patient has not been eating well and is throwing up a lot. Vital signs: T 39.5Â°C, HR 118/min, RR 20/min, BP 135/96 mm Hg. Physical exam reveals soft, moderately distended abdomen with tympanic sound and a strong response (\"stop that, it hurts\") to right upper abdominal quadrant palpation. Elevation of which of the following in the serum would be most suggestive of pancreatic injury in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "AST and ALT",
    "Creatinine and BUN",
    "Indirect bilirubin",
    "LDH and alkaline phosphatase",
    "Lipase and amylase"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever, along with tenderness in the right upper quadrant, raises suspicion for acute pancreatitis. The most specific and sensitive serum markers for pancreatic injury (inflammation) are lipase and amylase (Option E). While AST/ALT (Option A) are liver enzymes, Creatinine/BUN (Option B) are kidney function markers, Indirect bilirubin (Option C) is a marker of hemolysis or liver dysfunction, and LDH/Alkaline phosphatase (Option D) are general markers of tissue damage or cholestasis, none are as specific for pancreatic injury as lipase and amylase."

  "question": "A 45-year-old man presents with severe epigastric pain and nausea of 4-hours duration. During this time, the pain has progressively worsened and become more generalized with radiation to the back. His history is remarkable for irritable bowel syndrome and longstanding postprandial \"heartburn\" typically relieved with antacids. BP is 150/100 mmHg, HR 100, RR 24, and T 98Â° F. The patient is pale in appearance and listless, with minimal spontaneous movement. The pain worsens when the patient is turned for posterior chest and rectal examinations. Abdominal exam shows hypoactive bowel sounds, with involuntary guarding and rebound tenderness localized in the periumbilical region. Digital rectal exam reveals guaiac positive brown stool in the rectal vault and no palpable tenderness. Lab findings include BUN 35 mg/dL Cr 1.0 mg/dL. WBC 15.000/mm^3. Hb 14 g/dL platelets 450.000/mm^3, and amylase 115 U/L. EKG shows nonspecific ST segment changes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Acute inferior wall myocardial infarction",
    "Acute mechanical intestinal obstruction",
    "Acute pancreatitis",
    "Leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm",
    "Perforated peptic ulcer"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with severe, worsening epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, guarding, rebound tenderness, and guaiac positive brown stool. The elevated WBC count (15,000) suggests an inflammatory or infectious process. While acute pancreatitis (Option C) can present with similar pain and elevated amylase (though 115 U/L is borderline normal for this lab's stated reference range), the positive guaiac stool test is a strong indicator of gastrointestinal bleeding. The most fitting diagnosis, given the history of 'heartburn' and epigastric pain with signs of acute abdomen and GI bleeding, is a perforated peptic ulcer (Option E). A perforated ulcer leads to spillage of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis (guarding, rebound tenderness) and potential bleeding. Acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (Option A) would typically have EKG changes and cardiac markers. Acute mechanical intestinal obstruction (Option B) would present with more prominent abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation, and typically no GI bleeding. A leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm (Option D) would present with severe back pain and typically a pulsatile abdominal mass and hemodynamic instability, which is not fully consistent with this picture."

  "question": "A 2-year-old girl with bloody stools and severe anemia has an abnormal nuclear medicine \"Meckel's\" scan. The bleeding is most directly related to which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Angiodysplasia",
    "Gastric mucosa",
    "Mesenteric vascular ischemia",
    "Perforation of a Meckel's diverticulum",
    "Persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of bloody stools, severe anemia, and an abnormal Meckel's scan are classic for a Meckel's diverticulum. A Meckel's scan detects ectopic gastric mucosa by identifying uptake of technetium-99m pertechnetate by parietal cells. The bleeding in a Meckel's diverticulum is caused by ulceration of the adjacent small intestinal mucosa due to acid secreted by the ectopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum. Therefore, the bleeding is most directly related to the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa (Option B). Angiodysplasia (Option A) and Mesenteric vascular ischemia (Option C) are causes of GI bleeding but are not directly indicated by a Meckel's scan. Perforation (Option D) would cause peritonitis, not primarily bleeding. Persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct (Option E) is the embryological remnant from which Meckel's diverticulum forms, but it is the ectopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum that causes the bleeding, not the duct itself."

  "question": "A 50-year-old woman presents with a two-week history of nausea and epigastric pain that is aggravated by meals. Urea breath test is positive. Which of the following plays an important role in virulence of the causative organism?",
  "choices": [
    "Adhesins that mediate bacterial attachment to foveolar cells",
    "Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA)",
    "Flagella, which allow the bacteria to be motile in viscous mucus",
    "Urease, which generates ammonia from endogenous urea and thereby elevates gastric pH and enables bacterial survival",
    "All of the above"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (nausea, epigastric pain aggravated by meals) and positive urea breath test strongly indicate Helicobacter pylori infection. H. pylori possesses multiple virulence factors that enable its survival and pathogenicity in the stomach. These include: (A) **Adhesins** (e.g., BabA) for bacterial attachment to foveolar cells, allowing colonization. (B) **Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA)**, which is injected into host cells and contributes to inflammation and gastric damage. (C) **Flagella** for motility through the viscous mucus layer. (D) **Urease**, which hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and CO2, buffering gastric acid to create a more hospitable microenvironment for the bacteria to survive. Therefore, all of the listed factors play important roles in the virulence of H. pylori (Option E)."

  "question": "A 60-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with epigastric pain and dyspepsia of several-weeks duration. Physical examination is remarkable only for mild epigastric tenderness. Upper endoscopy with biopsy reveals the presence of spiral-shaped organisms in the gastric mucosa. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's disease?",
  "choices": [
    "Impaired gastric motility",
    "Induction of proinflammatory cytokines",
    "Inhibition of gastric acid secretion",
    "Mechanical obstruction",
    "Stimulation of gastric acid secretion"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The presence of spiral-shaped organisms in the gastric mucosa, along with epigastric pain and dyspepsia, strongly suggests Helicobacter pylori infection. H. pylori causes gastric inflammation and damage primarily by inducing a vigorous host inflammatory response. This involves the activation of immune cells and the release of various proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta) that contribute to gastritis and peptic ulcer formation. While H. pylori can affect gastric acid secretion (often leading to hypochlorhydria in atrophic gastritis or hyperchlorhydria in duodenal ulcers), the direct induction of proinflammatory cytokines is the most central mechanism of pathogenesis. Impaired gastric motility (Option A), mechanical obstruction (Option D), and direct inhibition or stimulation of gastric acid secretion (Options C and E) are not the primary mechanisms of pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced gastritis, though they can be secondary effects or related to complications."

  "question": "A 47-year-old man presents with fever, weight loss, and night sweats. A CT-scan shows multiple enlarged mediastinal and para-aortic lymph nodes. Biopsy confirms non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and he is started on rituximab therapy. Which of the following is the primary mechanism of action of rituximab in the treatment of this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Blockade of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor",
    "Blockade of T-cell co-stimulation",
    "Depletion of B-cells",
    "Inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6)",
    "Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±)"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient has non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is being treated with rituximab. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of B lymphocytes. Its primary mechanism of action is to induce the depletion of B-cells, including both normal and malignant B cells, through various mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and direct induction of apoptosis[cite: 77]. Options A, B, D, and E describe mechanisms of other immunomodulatory or biologic agents, not rituximab. Rituximab's efficacy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma stems directly from its ability to deplete cancerous B-cell clones."

He has no fever, and vital signs are unremarkable. Exam shows a mildly tender abdomen, without rebound tenderness or guarding. Murphy sign is negative. Lab findings are remarkable for low Hgb (11) and low MCV (78). An EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) shows several small gastric ulcers. The histopathologic examination of biopsied stomach lining reveals B-cell lymphoma (MALToma) and presence of urease enzyme. CT of the abdomen shows no lymphadenopathy. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
  "choices": [
    "Initiate treatment with clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole",
    "Initiate treatment with omeprazole, metronidazole, and clarithromycin",
    "Obtain PET scan prior to treating the patient",
    "Start IV rituximab"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient has gastric MALToma with H. pylori infection (presence of urease enzyme) and no lymphadenopathy on CT, indicating localized disease. He also has a penicillin allergy. For localized gastric MALT lymphoma associated with H. pylori, the first-line treatment is H. pylori eradication therapy. Standard triple therapy includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (e.g., omeprazole) plus two antibiotics, typically amoxicillin and clarithromycin. However, given his penicillin allergy, amoxicillin is contraindicated. A common alternative 'triple therapy' regimen for H. pylori with penicillin allergy is a PPI (omeprazole), metronidazole, and clarithromycin (Option B). A PET scan (Option C) is usually unnecessary for localized disease confirmed by CT without lymphadenopathy. Rituximab (Option D) is reserved for cases that fail H. pylori eradication or more advanced disease."

The wound requires suturing to prevent further complications. The patient is agitated, displaying rapid speech, and appears to be experiencing racing thoughts. He adamantly refuses any treatment and insists on leaving the hospital immediately. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step regarding obtaining consent for the procedure?",

    "Respect the patient's refusal of treatment and discharge him with appropriate wound care instructions.",
    "Determine the patient's capacity to make medical decisions.",
    "Convince the patient of the procedure's necessity by explaining the potential consequences of not receiving treatment."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The most appropriate first step when a patient refuses necessary medical treatment, especially if they have a condition that might affect their judgment (like an acute manic episode causing agitation, rapid speech, and racing thoughts), is to determine their capacity to make medical decisions. Capacity is decision-specific and can fluctuate. Even if a patient has a mental illness, they might still have capacity. Proceeding without consent (Option A) is generally unethical unless there's an immediate life-threatening emergency and no time for capacity assessment. Contacting family (Option B) is a secondary step if the patient is determined to lack capacity. Respecting refusal (Option C) would be appropriate only if the patient is found to have capacity. Attempting to convince (Option E) is part of the shared decision-making process but should follow, not precede, a capacity assessment if there are concerns."

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, fever, and jaundice (scleral icterus, yellowing of skin, elevated total and direct bilirubin). These three symptoms constitute Charcot's triad, which is classic for acute ascending cholangitis. The ultrasound finding of common bile duct (CBD) dilation with stone obstruction further supports this diagnosis, as CBD obstruction is a common etiology for cholangitis. The elevated WBC (18,000) indicates infection. While Acute Cholecystitis (Option A) also presents with RUQ pain and fever, jaundice is less common, and importantly, the ultrasound findings specifically exclude gallbladder distention and pericholecystic fluid, which would be indicative of acute cholecystitis. Cholangiocarcinoma (Option C) typically presents with painless jaundice, and an acute presentation with fever makes it less likely. Drug Toxicity (Option D) with LFTs > 1000 would be more indicative of liver injury rather than obstruction. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (Option E) is associated with ulcerative colitis and does not typically cause fever directly, nor would it be the acute presentation with stone obstruction."

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of chronic epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark stools (suggesting melena/upper GI bleed) along with upper endoscopy findings of numerous ulcerations and atrophic gastritis point to peptic ulcer disease. The mention of 'spiral-shaped organisms' in the provided image/context (Warthin-Starry silver stain is often used to visualize H. pylori) and the patient's recent immigration from Nigeria (a region with high H. pylori prevalence ) strongly suggest H. pylori infection as the cause. The best treatment for H. pylori infection causing peptic ulcer disease is 'triple therapy' (a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics). Option C, Omeprazole + Clarithromycin + Amoxicillin, is the standard triple therapy regimen. Option A (Cefotaxime/Ciprofloxacin) is used for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, not PUD. Option B (Omeprazole alone) is a PPI trial for GERD/PUD but lacks the necessary antibiotic component for H. pylori eradication. Option D (Prednisone) is for autoimmune gastritis, which is less likely given the acute infection signs. Option E (Rituximab) is used for lymphoma, which is not indicated in the current clinical picture (patient has stable vitals, no weight loss, no lymphadenopathy)."

  "question": "A 56-year-old woman is admitted to the Internal Medicine floor due to nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain. She was treated for abdominal pain in the clinic two years ago for GERD, which has been moderately controlled with up-titrating nizatidine. However, over the last three weeks, her pain has progressively worsened. The patient has also experienced a loss of appetite during this time. Physical exam reveals tenderness to palpation in the epigastrium. An upper GI endoscopy is performed, which reveals a 2.7 cm mass in the proximal duodenum. Biopsy of the mass reveals a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenic cause of this patient's biopsy finding?",
  "choices": [
    "Excessive nitrosamine exposure",
    "Pernicious anemia",
    "Excessive ibuprofen use",
    "H. pylori infection",
    "Excessive alcohol consumption"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's history of chronic epigastric pain progressing to a duodenal mass diagnosed as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma strongly points to Helicobacter pylori infection as the pathogenic cause. H. pylori infection is a well-established and strong predisposing risk factor for the development of gastric MALT lymphoma (and, less commonly, duodenal MALT lymphoma) due to chronic inflammation and lymphoid proliferation. The patient's history of GERD symptoms, even if not fully typical of H. pylori, does not rule out chronic infection. Excessive nitrosamine exposure (Option A) and pernicious anemia (Option B) are risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma, not MALT lymphoma. Excessive ibuprofen use (Option C) can lead to peptic ulcer disease but does not directly cause MALT lymphoma. Excessive alcohol consumption (Option E) is not a direct cause of MALT lymphoma, though it can contribute to other GI issues like pancreatitis."

  "question": "A 58-year-old woman is admitted to the Emergency Department due to nausea, vomiting, and fever of 2 days duration. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and major depressive disorder, which are currently well-controlled with albuterol and paroxetine, respectively. Her temperature is 38.9 C, BP is 93/56 mmHg, and pulse is 96/min. The patient appears ill, and she is oriented to time and person, but not place. Physical exam shows a yellow tinge to the skin. She moans when pressure is applied to the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.

If imaging is performed on this patient, it would show which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Inflammation of the gallbladder wall",
    "Common bile duct dilation",
    "Pancreatic irritation and fluid collection",
    "Increased liver echogenicity",
    "Obstruction of right proximal ureter"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with fever, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and jaundice (yellow tinge to skin, elevated total and direct bilirubin, elevated alkaline phosphatase) is consistent with acute cholangitis, which is inflammation of the bile ducts. Acute cholangitis is most commonly caused by obstruction of the common bile duct (CBD), usually by gallstones. Therefore, imaging, typically ultrasound, would most likely show common bile duct dilation (Option B). Option A (Inflammation of the gallbladder wall) would be indicative of acute cholecystitis, but while similar, cholangitis specifically implies bile duct involvement. Option C (Pancreatic irritation and fluid collection) would suggest pancreatitis, which is less likely with a normal lipase. Options D (Increased liver echogenicity) and E (Obstruction of right proximal ureter) are not characteristic findings for acute cholangitis."

  "question": "A 40-year-old woman with a history of nephrolithiasis presents to the emergency department (ED) with dysuria and frequent urination accompanied by chills and flank pain for the last two days. She states she has been vomiting all day, unable to keep down any food or analgesics. On exam, she appears pale with sunken eyes and dry oral mucosa. Vitals: T 39Â°C, P 120/min, BP 96/54 mmHg, RR 24/min. Lab findings: WBC 20x10^3/uL (4.5-11); Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL (0.6-1.2), BUN 40 mg/dL (10-20). Urinalysis is positive for nitrites and leukocyte esterase, TNTC (too numerous to count) WBCs/hpf, 100 RBCs/hpf, and numerous Gram-negative rods. A bedside renal ultrasound in the ED shows severe right hydronephrosis and an absent right ureteral jet in the bladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient's acute renal failure?",
  "choices": [
    "Intrarenal",
    "Prerenal",
    "Postrenal",
    "Pre-renal"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (dysuria, frequent urination, chills, flank pain) and signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, hypotension). Laboratory findings show elevated creatinine and BUN, indicating acute kidney injury. The renal ultrasound reveals severe right hydronephrosis and an absent right ureteral jet, which are strong indicators of an obstruction in the urinary tract. This obstruction prevents urine flow from the kidney, leading to acute postrenal kidney failure (Option C). Intrarenal (Option A) failure would involve direct damage to the kidney tubules or glomeruli. Prerenal (Option B) failure would be due to decreased renal perfusion, typically from dehydration or hypovolemia, though some degree of prerenal injury might coexist, the primary problem here is obstruction."

    "Escherichia coli",
    "Neisseria gonorrhoeae",
    "Staphylococcus saprophyticus"

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "Nitrites in urine are produced by the conversion of urinary nitrates by bacterial nitrate reductase. This enzyme is typically present in most Gram-negative bacteria commonly causing urinary tract infections (UTIs). Escherichia coli (Option C) is the most common Gram-negative uropathogen. Chlamydia trachomatis (Option A) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Option D) are common causes of sexually transmitted infections that can cause urethritis but typically do not produce nitrites. Enterococcus faecalis (Option B) is a Gram-positive coccus that typically does not produce nitrites. Staphylococcus saprophyticus (Option E) is a Gram-positive coccus, a common cause of UTIs in young women, but also does not produce nitrites."

This is a medical emergency requiring rapid intervention. Appropriate initial management includes: (A) Collecting blood and urine for culture and sensitivity to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. (B) Starting broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics empirically as soon as cultures are collected, given the signs of sepsis. (C) Initiating IV fluid resuscitation to address hypotension and hypovolemia. (D) Consulting urology urgently for potential drainage of the obstructed kidney (e.g., via ureteral stent or percutaneous nephrostomy).

    "Ureteroscopic lithotomy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient has severe right hydronephrosis due to an obstructing stone with signs of urosepsis. This constitutes an obstructed and infected kidney, which is a urological emergency requiring urgent decompression of the kidney. The most common and rapid methods for achieving this are placement of a ureteral stent (Option D) or percutaneous nephrostomy. A ureteral stent bypasses the obstruction by providing a conduit for urine flow from the kidney to the bladder. Laser lithotripsy (Option A), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (Option B), and shock wave lithotripsy (Option C) are methods for stone removal but are generally not the *initial* urgent intervention in the setting of an infected and obstructed kidney, which requires immediate decompression before definitive stone treatment. Ureteroscopic lithotomy (Option E) is a surgical procedure for stone removal, not the immediate decompression indicated in an emergency."

    "Cystine",
    "Uric acid",

    "Hypoxanthine"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "A",
  "explanation": "This is a matching question. The correct match for scenario 5 (recurrent UTIs by Proteus mirabilis) is Struvite stone (Option D). Proteus mirabilis is a urease-producing bacterium, meaning it breaks down urea into ammonia, increasing urine pH and promoting the formation of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones. The correct match for scenario 6 (Crohn's disease) is Calcium oxalate stone (Option A). Crohn's disease, especially with ileal involvement and fat malabsorption, can lead to increased oxalate absorption in the colon, predisposing to calcium oxalate stones. The correct match for scenario 7 (myeloproliferative disorder) is Uric acid stone (Option C). Myeloproliferative disorders cause increased cell turnover, leading to increased purine metabolism and elevated uric acid levels, predisposing to uric acid stones."

Her midstream urine culture yields 10^5 CFU/ml of urine of a uropathogen commonly found in the colonic flora. The patient's urine is positive for leukocyte esterase and nitrites. Which of the following factors promotes adhesion of the most likely uropathogen to the receptors found on both human erythrocytes and uroepithelial cells?",
  "choices": [
    "Endotoxin",
    "Exotoxin",
    "Flagella",
    "P fimbriae",

  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (dysuria, frequent urination), positive leukocyte esterase (indicating pyuria) and nitrites (indicating Gram-negative bacteria), and a culture of 10^5 CFU/ml of a uropathogen commonly found in colonic flora, which strongly suggests E. coli. For E. coli, P fimbriae (pyelonephritis-associated pilus, Option D) are a major virulence factor that promotes adhesion to specific glycolipid receptors found on uroepithelial cells (and erythrocytes, leading to hemagglutination). While Type 1 pili (Option E) also mediate E. coli adhesion to uroepithelium (mannose-sensitive), P fimbriae are particularly associated with adherence to upper urinary tract cells and pyelonephritis. Endotoxin (Option A) and exotoxin (Option B) are general bacterial toxins, and flagella (Option C) are for motility, but none are the primary factors promoting adhesion in this context."

  "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with symptoms of frequent urination, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency, and weak urinary stream. Digital rectal exam reveals smooth, firm, elastic enlargement of the prostate. Urinalysis, renal function tests, and serum PSA are within normal range. The patient is likely to benefit from pharmacotherapy with which of the following drugs?",
  "choices": [
    "alpha1A-adrenergic receptor antagonist",
    "alpha1B-vascular adrenergic receptor blocker",
    "alpha1D-adrenenolytic agent",
    "5alpha-reductase inhibitor",
    "Aromatase inhibitor"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (frequent urination, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency, weak stream) and physical exam finding (smooth, firm, elastic prostate enlargement) are classic for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Given that his urinalysis, renal function tests, and PSA are normal, medical management is appropriate. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (alpha-blockers) are a first-line pharmacotherapy for BPH. They relax the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, reducing bladder outlet obstruction and improving urinary flow. Specifically, selective alpha1A-adrenergic receptor antagonists (Option A) are preferred as they target receptors primarily found in the prostate, minimizing systemic side effects like orthostatic hypotension that are more associated with alpha1B-vascular adrenergic receptor blockers (Option B). 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (Option D) are also used for BPH to shrink the prostate by inhibiting testosterone conversion, but alpha-blockers provide faster symptom relief. Alpha1D-adrenolytic agent (Option C) is not a standard classification. Aromatase inhibitors (Option E) are used in breast cancer treatment."

  "question": "A 35-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with severe abdominal pain of acute onset 30 minutes ago. The pain is colic-like and left-sided with radiation to his left testicle. He vomited once 15 minutes ago. He is writhing in pain and has mild tenderness to palpation of his abdomen and left CVA tenderness. Urinalysis shows microscopic hematuria. Which of the following is most sensitive for confirming this condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Helical CT of the abdomen and pelvis",
    "Intravenous pyelogram",
    "MRI of the abdomen and pelvis",
    "Nuclear renography",
    "Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with acute onset, severe, colicky left-sided flank pain radiating to the left testicle, nausea, vomiting, and microscopic hematuria is classic for renal colic caused by a ureteral stone. The most sensitive imaging modality for confirming the presence of a kidney stone, especially an obstructing ureteral stone, is a non-contrast helical CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Option A). CT is rapid, highly sensitive for all stone compositions (including radiolucent ones), and can detect complications like hydronephrosis. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP, Option B) involves contrast and radiation exposure and is less sensitive than CT. MRI (Option C) is generally not the first-line for stones due to lower sensitivity for calcifications and longer scan time. Nuclear renography (Option D) assesses renal function and drainage but is not the primary imaging for stone detection. Ultrasound (Option E) can detect hydronephrosis and large stones, but its sensitivity for small or ureteral stones is lower than CT, especially in obese patients."

{
  "question": "Which of the following would strongly suggest a serious complication of this patient's condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Difficulty relieving the pain",
    "Fever",
    "Gross hematuria",
    "Hypercalcemia",
    "Increased serum uric acid"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient has symptoms consistent with a kidney stone. While kidney stones are often extremely painful and can cause gross hematuria, the most serious complication is infection proximal to the obstruction, leading to pyelonephritis or urosepsis. Therefore, the presence of fever (Option B) in a patient with an obstructing kidney stone strongly suggests an infected and obstructed kidney, which is a urological emergency requiring urgent intervention (e.g., decompression and antibiotics) to prevent septic shock and renal damage. Difficulty relieving pain (Option A) indicates severe pain but not necessarily a serious complication beyond pain itself. Gross hematuria (Option C) is common with stones and not necessarily a complication. Hypercalcemia (Option D) and increased serum uric acid (Option E) are risk factors for certain stone types, not acute complications of a current stone."

  "question": "A 42-year-old man has suffered two episodes of urolithiasis in the past year. On each occasion, the stone spontaneously passed. Analysis of one stone showed that it was composed primarily of calcium oxalate. His BUN and serum creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, and uric acid are normal. Hypercalciuria is documented in a 24-hour urine collection. He is instructed to consume adequate fluids to maintain urine output of at least 2 L per 24 hours. What additional recommendation is appropriate?",
  "choices": [
    "Increased intake of animal protein",
    "Low calcium diet",
    "Oral furosemide",
    "Oral potassium citrate"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient has recurrent calcium oxalate stones and documented hypercalciuria (excess calcium in urine) despite normal serum calcium. This indicates idiopathic hypercalciuria, a common cause of calcium oxalate stones. While adequate fluid intake is essential, an additional appropriate recommendation for recurrent calcium oxalate stones with hypercalciuria is oral potassium citrate (Option D). Potassium citrate acts by increasing urinary citrate levels (which chelates calcium, preventing its crystallization) and by raising urinary pH (making calcium oxalate less soluble). Increased intake of animal protein (Option A) would increase urinary calcium and uric acid, promoting stone formation. A low calcium diet (Option B) is generally not recommended as it can worsen oxalate absorption and bone health; normal calcium intake is usually advised. Oral furosemide (Option C) is a loop diuretic that increases urinary calcium excretion and would worsen hypercalciuria, thereby increasing stone risk."

  "choices": [
    "Hematuria",
    "Hemolytic anemia",
    "Low serum cortisol",
    "Myoglobinuria",
    "Respiratory acidosis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient is a marathon runner who presents after a long run with dark urine, muscle aches, disorientation, dry skin, postural hypotension, tender muscles, hyperkalemia (K 6.4), elevated creatinine (3.0), and mild metabolic acidosis (HCO3 19). This constellation of symptoms and lab findings is classic for rhabdomyolysis, likely induced by strenuous exercise and possibly exacerbated by dehydration and NSAID use. Rhabdomyolysis involves the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, releasing muscle contents into the bloodstream. Therefore, further workup is most likely to show myoglobinuria (Option D), which causes the dark urine and can lead to acute kidney injury (as evidenced by elevated creatinine). Hematuria (Option A) might be present but myoglobinuria is more specific to rhabdomyolysis. Hemolytic anemia (Option B) is ruled out by normal hgb/hct and normal chloride. Low serum cortisol (Option C) is inconsistent with the presentation. Respiratory acidosis (Option E) would involve a high pCO2, but the patient's presentation suggests a metabolic acidosis."

    "CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast",
    "IVP (intravenous pyelogram)",
    "MRI of the kidneys",

  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with flank pain and hematuria, symptoms highly suggestive of a kidney stone. For the evaluation of suspected urolithiasis, especially in the acute setting, a non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Option B) is the imaging procedure of choice. It is highly sensitive for detecting all types of kidney stones (regardless of their composition), provides rapid results, and can identify complications like hydronephrosis. CT with IV contrast (Option A) is generally avoided for stone workup as contrast can obscure the stone and is not necessary to visualize stones. IVP (Option C) involves radiation and contrast, is less sensitive than CT, and takes longer. MRI (Option D) is less sensitive for calcified stones and is not the first-line. Ultrasound (Option E) can detect hydronephrosis and large stones but has lower sensitivity for small or ureteral stones, especially mid-ureteral stones, and is less precise than CT."

The pathogen and mechanism by which this stone has formed are most likely:",
  "choices": [
    "Escherichia coli: ammonia secretion",
    "Klebsiella pneumoniae: urea secretion",
    "Proteus mirabilis: urease production",
    "Serratia marcescens: production of red pigment that precipitates stone",
    "Staphylococcus saprophyticus: production of magnesium binding proteins"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with recurrent UTIs and a large renal pelvis stone (staghorn calculus) composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium carbonate-apatite. These are characteristic components of struvite stones, also known as infection stones. Struvite stones form in alkaline urine, typically caused by urease-producing bacteria that hydrolyze urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, which raises urine pH and promotes the precipitation of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate. Proteus mirabilis (Option C) is a common urease-producing bacterium responsible for struvite stone formation. Escherichia coli (Option A) is a common UTI pathogen but generally does not produce urease. Klebsiella pneumoniae (Option B) can produce urease, but Proteus mirabilis is the classic association for struvite stones. Serratia marcescens (Option D) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (Option E) are less common causes of struvite stones, and their mechanisms of stone formation are not as directly linked to their virulence factors as urease production by Proteus."

    "Colonization of the introitus by fecal flora",
    "Contamination of the urethral os by normal skin flora",
    "Hematogenous transmission of E. coli to bladder mucosa",
    "Overgrowth of vaginal Lactobacillus",
    "Vesicoureteral reflux"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with urinary frequency, dysuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria, without fever, is consistent with an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (cystitis). In women, UTIs are most commonly caused by bacteria ascending from the periurethral area into the bladder. The initial step in this pathogenesis is the colonization of the vaginal introitus and periurethral area by fecal flora, primarily Gram-negative enteric bacteria like E. coli (Option A). Contamination of the urethral os by normal skin flora (Option B) is less specific and typically does not involve fecal organisms. Hematogenous transmission of E. coli (Option C) is a very rare route for UTI. Overgrowth of vaginal Lactobacillus (Option D) is generally protective and does not cause UTIs. Vesicoureteral reflux (Option E) is a risk factor for recurrent UTIs and pyelonephritis, but it describes a structural abnormality that predisposes to infection, not the initial pathogenic step of bacterial entry."

  "question": "A 74-year-old woman with osteoarthritis is prescribed 600 mg of ibuprofen QID to treat pain in her knees. Prior to initiating this drug therapy, her serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL. She is seen back in the clinic 3 weeks later. Her pains have resolved, but her serum creatinine is now 1.4 mg/dL. Urinalysis is normal. What renal mechanism most likely accounts for the increase in creatinine?",
  "choices": [
    "Constriction of afferent arterioles",
    "Deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane",
    "Decreased tubular secretion of creatinine",
    "Fusion of glomerular epithelial foot processes",
    "Proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's acute kidney injury (rise in creatinine from 0.8 to 1.4 mg/dL) after starting ibuprofen (an NSAID) is a classic example of NSAID-induced acute kidney injury. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins normally cause vasodilation of the afferent arterioles in the glomerulus, which is crucial for maintaining glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in situations of reduced renal perfusion (like in elderly patients or those with underlying conditions). Inhibition of prostaglandins by NSAIDs leads to unopposed vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles (Option A), resulting in decreased blood flow to the glomerulus, reduced GFR, and thus an increase in serum creatinine. Deposition of immune complexes (Option B) and fusion of glomerular epithelial foot processes (Option D) are associated with glomerular diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome). Decreased tubular secretion of creatinine (Option C) is less likely the primary mechanism for such a significant increase. Proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells (Option E) is seen in certain glomerular diseases."

  "question": "A 40-year-old man has had severe left flank pain with radiation to his left testicle for the past hour. KUB shows a single small calcification on the left side. Where is the stone most likely located?",
  "choices": [
    "Parenchyma of the left kidney",
    "A calyx of the left kidney",
    "In the mid-portion of the left ureter",
    "At the left ureter-bladder junction",
    "In the bladder"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's severe left flank pain radiating to the left testicle is classic for renal colic caused by a ureteral stone. Kidney stones tend to lodge at three common anatomical narrowings in the ureter: (1) the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), (2) where the ureter crosses the iliac vessels, and (3) the ureterovesical junction (UVJ), where the ureter enters the bladder. Pain radiating to the testicle is highly characteristic of a stone located distally in the ureter, particularly at the ureter-bladder junction (Option D) or just before it. A stone in the renal parenchyma (Option A) or a calyx (Option B) would cause flank pain but typically without radiation to the groin/testicle. A stone in the mid-portion of the ureter (Option C) might radiate to the groin but is less specific for testicular pain than a distal ureteral stone. A stone in the bladder (Option E) would cause bladder symptoms (e.g., dysuria, frequency, urgency), not flank pain with radiation to the testicle."

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient has Crohn's disease with chronic steatorrhea, and now presents with flank pain and hematuria, strongly suggesting a kidney stone. Patients with Crohn's disease, especially those with ileal involvement and fat malabsorption leading to steatorrhea, are at increased risk of calcium oxalate kidney stones due to hyperoxaluria (Option A). In steatorrhea, unabsorbed fatty acids bind to calcium in the gut lumen, leaving free oxalate to be excessively absorbed in the colon. This increased absorption of oxalate leads to hyperoxaluria and increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Hyperuricosuria (Option B) can cause uric acid stones, but it's not the primary mechanism linked to Crohn's and steatorrhea. Hypercalciuria (Option C) can cause calcium stones but is not the specific link to Crohn's. Hypocitraturia (Option D) is a risk factor for calcium stones, but it's not the primary *cause* linked to Crohn's. Hypouricosuria (Option E) is not a common cause of stones."

He presents with fever and chills (suggesting systemic infection/urosepsis) and blood-tinged urine. The accompanying image (if shown, typically depicting 'coffin-lid' shaped crystals) in the context of a UTI, especially with a catheter, points to a struvite stone. Struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate) are formed by urease-producing bacteria (Option D) (e.g., Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas). These bacteria hydrolyze urea into ammonia and CO2, creating an alkaline urine environment that facilitates the precipitation of struvite crystals. Therefore, the presence of a urease-producing organism is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation, including the potential for struvite stone formation leading to obstruction and infection. Elevated urinary calcium (Option A) and fatty acid malabsorption (Option C) are associated with calcium oxalate stones. Renal tubular acidosis (Option B) can cause certain types of kidney stones, but not typically struvite stones in this context. Medication adverse effect (Option E) is too general."

  "question": "A 48-year-old man comes to the ED because of 2-hour history of severe-left sided colicky flank pain that radiates to his groin. He has had two episodes of emesis. Last year, he was treated with ibuprofen for swelling and pain in his left toe. The patient's only medication is allopurinol; however, the patient states he has been non-compliant with his medication. Patient drinks 4-5 beers most days and consumes significant red meat. On exam he has left CVA tenderness. Upright KUB radiograph reveals no abnormalities. CT abdomen pelvis shows a 9-mm stone in the left proximal ureter. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on urinalysis?",
  "choices": [
    "Coffin-lid like crystals",
    "Hexagon-shaped crystals",
    "RBC casts",
    "Rhomboid-shaped crystals",
    "Wedge-shaped crystals"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with classic renal colic (left flank pain radiating to groin, emesis, CVA tenderness) and a history consistent with gout (allopurinol use, previous toe pain/swelling, red meat, alcohol intake). A non-contrast CT shows a 9-mm stone in the left proximal ureter, but the KUB radiograph is normal, indicating a radiolucent stone. The only common kidney stone that is radiolucent on plain X-ray (KUB) is a uric acid stone. Uric acid stones are typically found in patients with gout and form in acidic urine. On urinalysis, uric acid crystals most commonly appear as rhomboid-shaped crystals (Option D). Coffin-lid like crystals (Option A) are characteristic of struvite stones. Hexagon-shaped crystals (Option B) are characteristic of cystine stones. RBC casts (Option C) are seen in glomerular nephritis. Wedge-shaped crystals (Option E) are associated with calcium phosphate stones."

  "question": "On urinalysis, what is the most likely pH?",
  "choices": [
    "8.3",
    "7.1",
    "6.8",
    "6.2",
    "5.2"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "Following from the previous question, the patient has a uric acid stone. Uric acid stones typically form in acidic urine. Therefore, the most likely pH on urinalysis would be an acidic pH. Among the given options, 5.2 (Option D) is the most acidic and thus most consistent with uric acid stone formation. A pH of 8.3 (Option A) would be highly alkaline, characteristic of struvite stones. pH values of 7.1 and 7.4 (Options B and C) are slightly alkaline or near neutral, which are not conducive to uric acid stone formation."

  "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of fever, chills, and severe flank pain on her right side. She reports a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. A physical examination revealed costovertebral angle tenderness on the right side. Urinalysis demonstrates bacteriuria and white blood cell casts. A renal ultrasound is performed and reveals an enlarged, hypoechoic right kidney with loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Which of the following gross anatomical findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Ureteropelvic junction obstruction",
    "Renal cell carcinoma",
    "Renal papillary necrosis",
    "Renal vein thrombosis",
    "Ureterovesical junction obstruction"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with fever, chills, severe flank pain, recurrent UTIs, CVA tenderness, bacteriuria, WBC casts, and an enlarged, hypoechoic right kidney with loss of corticomedullary differentiation on ultrasound. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of acute pyelonephritis, possibly complicated by renal papillary necrosis (RPN). RPN (Option C) is a condition characterized by necrosis of the renal papillae, often caused by ischemia due to severe pyelonephritis, analgesic abuse, or sickle cell disease. It is associated with recurrent UTIs and can lead to passage of necrotic papillary tissue. WBC casts indicate upper UTI (pyelonephritis). Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (Option A) or ureterovesical junction obstruction (Option E) could predispose to pyelonephritis but are not the *gross anatomical finding* directly caused by the severe infection described. Renal cell carcinoma (Option B) and renal vein thrombosis (Option D) would have different clinical presentations and imaging findings."

  "question": "A 25-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of blood in his urine and swelling of his face and lower extremities over the past week. He reports no recent illnesses or infections. Physical examination reveals hypertension, periorbital edema, and mild abdominal discomfort. Urinalysis shows RBC casts and proteinuria. Renal biopsy demonstrates subepithelial humps on electron microscopy. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely contributing to this patient's condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli",
    "Activation of the alternative complement pathway",
    "Basement membrane disruption due to autoimmune attack",
    "Decreased synthesis of type IV collagen",
    "Impaired podocyte function"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with hematuria, periorbital edema, facial and lower extremity swelling, hypertension, proteinuria, and RBC casts (indicating glomerulonephritis) is classic for a nephritic syndrome. The renal biopsy finding of subepithelial humps on electron microscopy is pathognomonic for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes (typically containing antibodies against streptococcal antigens) in the glomeruli (Option A). This deposition leads to inflammation, complement activation (often classical pathway, not primarily alternative as in Option B), and subsequent damage to the glomerular basement membrane. Basement membrane disruption (Option C) and impaired podocyte function (Option E) occur as a *result* of immune complex deposition and inflammation, but the immune complex deposition is the primary pathogenic mechanism. Decreased synthesis of type IV collagen (Option D) is associated with Alport syndrome, a hereditary nephritic syndrome, but not with PSGN."

  "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with severe colicky flank pain radiating to the groin on the right side, which started 45 minutes ago while he was eating dinner. He describes having nausea and vomiting during this time. He has a history of HTN and only takes amlodipine. Vital signs: Temp 37.0Â°C, BP 135/85 mmHg, HR 110/min, RR 20/min. Physical exam shows right sided CVA tenderness. Labs reveal mild leukocytosis with other values within normal range. UA shows blood in the urine with microscopy revealing 5-10 RBCs/hpf and no other abnormal findings. A non-contrast CT is most likely to reveal what finding?",
  "choices": [
    "A calcium oxalate kidney stone located at the Uteropelvic Junction (UPJ)",
    "Parenchymal enlargement and destruction of the right kidney",
    "A struvite kidney stone located at the UPJ",
    "Hypodense thrombus within the lumen of the right renal artery",
    "Distention, wall thickening, and pericholecystic fat stranding in the right upper quadrant"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with acute, severe, colicky flank pain radiating to the groin, nausea, vomiting, and microscopic hematuria, along with CVA tenderness, is classic for renal colic due to a kidney stone. Non-contrast CT is the gold standard for diagnosing kidney stones. Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stone (80% of cases) and are radiopaque. Kidney stones frequently lodge at anatomical narrowings, with the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) (Option A) being one of the most common sites. Parenchymal enlargement and destruction (Option B) is not typical for an acute stone. Struvite stones (Option C) are also radiopaque and can occur at the UPJ, but are usually associated with UTIs by urease-producing bacteria and staghorn calculi, not implied here. A hypodense thrombus in the renal artery (Option D) would suggest renal artery thrombosis, causing ischemic pain, but imaging would show signs of ischemia, not necessarily a stone. Distention, wall thickening, and pericholecystic fat stranding (Option E) are indicative of acute cholecystitis, not kidney stone."

  "question": "A 65-year old man presents with symptoms of frequent urination, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency, and weak urinary stream. Digital rectal exam reveals smooth, firm, elastic enlargement of the prostate. Urinalysis, renal function tests, and serum PSA are within normal range. What is the mechanism of action of the drug of choice for this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "alpha1A-adrenergic receptor antagonist",
    "5alpha-reductase inhibitor",
    "alpha1B-vascular adrenergic receptor blocker",
    "Aromatase inhibitor",
    "alpha1D-adrenenolytic agent"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (frequent urination, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency, weak urinary stream) and physical exam finding of a smooth, firm, elastic prostate enlargement, with normal urinalysis, renal function tests, and PSA, are classic for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). The drug of choice for symptomatic relief in BPH is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist. These drugs act by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby reducing bladder outlet obstruction and improving urinary flow. Specifically, alpha1A-adrenergic receptor antagonists (Option A) are preferred as they primarily target receptors in the prostate, minimizing systemic side effects like orthostatic hypotension that are more associated with non-selective alpha-blockers (like alpha1B-vascular adrenergic receptor blockers, Option C). 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (Option B) are another class used for BPH to shrink the prostate size but have a slower onset of action. Aromatase inhibitors (Option D) are used in other conditions, not BPH. Alpha1D-adrenolytic agent (Option E) is not a standard classification; selective alpha-1 blockers are more precisely classified by subtype (A, B, D)."

  "question": "A 58-year old African-American man inquires about the value of screening for prostate cancer by measuring serum PSA. Which of the following statements is accurate?",
  "choices": [
    "The PSA test is more sensitive than the alternative method of screening",
    "The specificity of serum PSA for distinguishing between cancer and BPH is high",
    "Most men with an elevated PSA have prostate cancer",
    "The prevalence of cancer at this age is too low to justify screening",
    "The risk of prostate cancer is lower in African-American men than in white men"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "Regarding PSA screening for prostate cancer, the statement that the PSA test is more sensitive than alternative screening methods (like digital rectal exam alone) is accurate (Option A). PSA is a relatively sensitive test for prostate cancer, meaning it can detect many cases, but its specificity for distinguishing between prostate cancer and benign conditions like BPH is low (Option B is incorrect). Therefore, most men with an elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer (Option C is incorrect). The prevalence of prostate cancer increases with age, and screening decisions at age 58 involve a discussion of risks and benefits, not that the prevalence is too low to justify screening (Option D is incorrect). Lastly, African-American men actually have a higher incidence and mortality from prostate cancer compared to white men, making Option E incorrect."

  "question": "A 62-year old man has had decreasing force of his urinary stream for several years. He has day-time urinary frequency and gets up 2 to 3 times each night to urinate. On exam, his prostate is symmetrically enlarged and has no nodules. Urinalysis is normal; serum PSA is borderline elevated; and prostate ultrasound is unremarkable. Management of this patient is most likely to include a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action?",
  "choices": [
    "Increases contractility of the detrusor muscle",
    "Inhibits sympathetic nerves in the bladder outlet",
    "Blocks conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone",
    "Relaxes smooth muscle of the urinary sphincter",
    "Suppresses gonadotropin release from the anterior pituitary"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (decreasing stream force, frequency, nocturia) and physical exam (symmetrically enlarged prostate, no nodules), along with normal urinalysis and borderline elevated PSA, are consistent with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). In addition to alpha-blockers (which relax smooth muscle), another class of drugs used for BPH, especially with a larger prostate volume or if alpha-blockers are insufficient, are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. These drugs (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) act by blocking the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is the primary androgen responsible for prostate growth. By blocking this conversion, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors reduce prostate size and improve symptoms over time (Option C). Increasing contractility of the detrusor muscle (Option A) would be for an underactive bladder. Inhibiting sympathetic nerves (Option B) or relaxing smooth muscle of the urinary sphincter (Option D) are mechanisms of alpha-blockers, which are used for BPH but are not the only option. Suppressing gonadotropin release (Option E) would be relevant for androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer."

  "question": "A 71-year old man has urinary hesitancy, weak stream, post-void dribbling and nocturia. His prostate is enlarged and serum PSA is high. Needle biopsy shows nodular hyperplasia. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathophysiology of this condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Atrophy of glandular components in the transitional zone",
    "Proliferation of glandular components in the peripheral zone",
    "Proliferation of glandular and stromal components in the transitional zone",
    "Parasympathetic stimulation of smooth muscle around the prostatic capsule",
    "Proliferation of stromal components in the peripheral zone"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (urinary hesitancy, weak stream, post-void dribbling, nocturia), enlarged prostate, high PSA, and biopsy showing nodular hyperplasia are characteristic of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland that occurs with aging. Its pathophysiology involves the proliferation of both glandular epithelial and stromal (connective tissue and smooth muscle) components within the transitional zone of the prostate (Option C). The transitional zone is the area around the urethra. Proliferation of glandular components in the peripheral zone (Option B) and proliferation of stromal components in the peripheral zone (Option E) are incorrect because BPH primarily affects the transitional zone. Atrophy of glandular components (Option A) is contrary to hyperplasia. Parasympathetic stimulation (Option D) is involved in bladder contraction, not the hyperplasia of the prostate gland itself."

  "question": "A 61-year-old Black man with a 40-pack-year history of smoking and a family history of prostate cancer presents with progressive urgency to void for the last month to the present level of nearly every 30-40 minutes. Prior to that, he had several years of some urinary frequency. Associated symptoms have included nearly continuous urinary dribbling after voiding requiring an incontinence pad, straining to void, and three episodes of gross hematuria in the past month. Which of the following is the most appropriate first step in the workup of hematuria in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Cystoscopy and CT urogram",
    "Digital rectal exam",
    "KUB X-ray",
    "Renal ultrasound",
    "Urinalysis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "This patient presents with several risk factors for urological malignancy (age, Black race, family history of prostate cancer, smoking history, gross hematuria) and symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction. The presence of gross hematuria (visible blood in urine), especially in a patient with these risk factors, mandates a thorough workup to rule out malignancy. The most appropriate first step in the workup of gross hematuria, particularly in a high-risk patient, is a combination of cystoscopy (to visualize the bladder and urethra) and a CT urogram (CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to visualize the kidneys, ureters, and bladder) (Option A). This comprehensive imaging and endoscopic evaluation is crucial to identify potential tumors or other sources of bleeding in the entire urinary tract. A digital rectal exam (Option B) would be part of a prostate cancer workup but is not the comprehensive first step for gross hematuria. KUB X-ray (Option C) and renal ultrasound (Option D) are less sensitive and comprehensive than a CT urogram. Urinalysis (Option E) confirms hematuria but does not identify its source."

  "question": "The hematuria workup should take precedent in the patient described in the preceding scenario to rule out which of the following \"must not miss\" diagnoses?",
  "choices": [
    "Adenocarcinoma of the prostate",
    "Benign prostate hypertrophy",
    "Neprhrolithiasis",
    "Pyelonephritis",
    "Urothelial cell carcinoma"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "In the preceding scenario, the patient presents with gross hematuria and several risk factors for urological malignancy (age, smoking, family history of prostate cancer, Black race). While benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH, Option B) and nephrolithiasis (kidney stones, Option C) can cause hematuria, and prostate adenocarcinoma (Option A) is a concern, the 'must not miss' diagnosis in the setting of gross hematuria with these risk factors is Urothelial cell carcinoma (Option E). Urothelial carcinoma (also known as transitional cell carcinoma) can arise anywhere along the urothelium, including the bladder, ureters, and renal pelvis, and is strongly associated with smoking. Given the gross hematuria and absence of other clear causes (like recent stone passage), ruling out this malignancy is paramount."

  "question": "A 30-year old woman reports producing large volumes of urine and drinking a lot of water over the past few months. She has no other symptoms; physical exam is normal, and urine dipstick is negative for glucose, protein and leukocytes. Which set of findings would be most consistent with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?",
  "choices": [
    "Urine Osmolality: Low, Serum Sodium: High, Serum Vasopressin: Low",
    "Urine Osmolality: Low, Serum Sodium: Low, Serum Vasopressin: Low",
    "Urine Osmolality: High, Serum Sodium: High, Serum Vasopressin: High",
    "Urine Osmolality: High, Serum Sodium: Low, Serum Vasopressin: Low",
    "Urine Osmolality: Low, Serum Sodium: High, Serum Vasopressin: High"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a condition where the kidneys are unable to respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH/vasopressin), leading to the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine (low urine osmolality). Despite the low urine osmolality, the body attempts to compensate by increasing ADH production. Therefore, in NDI, you would expect: (1) Low urine osmolality (dilute urine) because the kidneys can't concentrate urine. (2) High serum sodium (hypernatremia) due to excessive water loss. (3) High serum vasopressin (ADH) levels, as the pituitary tries to compensate for the kidneys' unresponsiveness. Option E, Urine Osmolality: Low, Serum Sodium: High, Serum Vasopressin: High, perfectly matches this biochemical profile for NDI. Option A describes central DI. Option B and D describe hyponatremia. Option C describes SIADH."

    "Fibromuscular dysplasia of renal artery",
    "Horseshoe kidney",
    "Hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis",
    "Unilateral renal agenesis",

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The infant presents with fever, irritability, pyuria (too numerous to count WBCs), WBC casts (indicating pyelonephritis), and a positive E. coli urine culture. This is a severe urinary tract infection, likely pyelonephritis. In infants with a severe UTI, especially pyelonephritis, a renal anomaly is a common predisposing factor. Among the given options, a horseshoe kidney (Option B) is a congenital anomaly where the kidneys are fused, often at their lower poles, and can be associated with an increased risk of UTIs and urinary obstruction. While other options represent renal anomalies, a horseshoe kidney is a recognized association with recurrent UTIs and often investigated on follow-up imaging. Fibromuscular dysplasia (Option A) is a vascular disorder. Hydronephrosis from retroperitoneal fibrosis (Option C) is usually an acquired condition in older individuals. Unilateral renal agenesis (Option D) would mean only one kidney is present. Wilms' tumor (Option E) is a malignant renal tumor, but this presentation is acute infection, not a tumor."

    "Prostate massage, oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole",
    "Urine culture, IV ceftriaxone"

  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient is a 58-year-old man presenting with dysuria, frequency, fever (38.5Â°C), malaise, and signs of a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites on dipstick). His age and presentation with fever suggest a complicated UTI, likely pyelonephritis or acute bacterial prostatitis, rather than simple cystitis. For a complicated UTI in a male with systemic symptoms, initial management typically involves obtaining a urine culture and sensitivity (to guide therapy) and initiating empiric intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. IV ceftriaxone (Option E) is an appropriate choice for empiric treatment of complicated UTIs, providing good coverage. Prostate massage and split urine cultures (Options A, B, D) are used to diagnose prostatitis but should not delay empiric antibiotic therapy in a febrile patient. Oral nitrofurantoin (Option C) is usually reserved for uncomplicated cystitis and would not be appropriate for a febrile male with suspected pyelonephritis or prostatitis."

  "question": "An asymptomatic 70-year old man with an elevated serum PSA is found to have low-grade adenocarcinoma of the prostate on needle biopsy. Based on clinical workup, the cancer is considered confined to the prostate. Radical prostatectomy is seriously considered and the patient has many questions about possible outcomes of this surgery. Which statement about radical prostatectomy is accurate based on current research evidence?",
  "choices": [
    "The probability that the cancer is not confined to the prostate is 20%",
    "The risk of 30-day post-operative mortality is 5%",
    "The risk of some degree of incontinence is over 60%",
    "The risk of sexual dysfunction is over 60%"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient has localized prostate cancer for which radical prostatectomy is considered. Radical prostatectomy can significantly impact quality of life due to potential complications. Among the listed options, the risk of sexual dysfunction (erectile dysfunction) after radical prostatectomy is indeed high, often cited as over 60% (Option D), even with nerve-sparing techniques, though it can improve over time. The probability of cancer being confined to the prostate (Option A) would depend on specific staging parameters (PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage) but 20% might be too high for a 'confined' tumor. The risk of 30-day post-operative mortality (Option B) for radical prostatectomy is much lower than 5% (typically well below 1%). The risk of some degree of incontinence (Option C) is also significant but usually less than 60% for a permanent severe type, though mild stress incontinence is very common."

  "question": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with leuprolide is considered in a 65-year-old man with prostate cancer. What is the rationale for this type of ADT?",
  "choices": [
    "Attenuation of the effects of bcl-2 and bel-xL gene expression",
    "Desensitization of the LHRH receptors, resulting in downregulation of LH and testosterone production",
    "Inhibition of microtubular depolymerization",
    "Interaction with the androgen receptor resulting in inhibition of translocation of the activated receptor complex to the nucleus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Leuprolide is a Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonist (also called LHRH agonist). When continuously administered, GnRH agonists initially cause a surge in LH and FSH, but then lead to paradoxical desensitization and downregulation of LHRH receptors on the pituitary gonadotrophs. This desensitization results in a sustained decrease in LH and FSH secretion, which in turn reduces testosterone production by the testes. Since prostate cancer growth is often androgen-dependent, reducing testosterone levels inhibits tumor growth (Option B). Attenuation of bcl-2/bcl-xL (Option A) relates to anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Inhibition of microtubular depolymerization (Option C) describes the mechanism of action of taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel), a chemotherapy drug. Interaction with the androgen receptor (Option D) describes the mechanism of antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide), which directly block the androgen receptor."

    "Increased serum alkaline phosphatase",
    "Elevated PSA",
    "New onset groin pain",
    "Loss of appetite",
    "Nausea/vomiting"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient has prostate adenocarcinoma. Prostate cancer commonly metastasizes to bone, particularly the axial skeleton (spine, pelvis, ribs). Bone metastases, whether osteoblastic (most common in prostate cancer) or osteolytic, lead to increased bone turnover. An increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (Option A) is a common and reliable indicator of increased osteoblastic activity, which is a hallmark of prostate cancer bone metastases. Elevated PSA (Option B) is indicative of prostate cancer but does not specifically differentiate between localized and metastatic disease. New onset groin pain (Option C), loss of appetite (Option D), and nausea/vomiting (Option E) are non-specific symptoms that can be associated with advanced cancer or other conditions, but are not as direct or specific indicators of bone metastasis as elevated ALP."

Radiographs reveal lesions in the spine best described as which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Nodular",
    "Osteoclastic",
    "Mixed osteoblastic-osteoclastic",
    "Osteoblastic",
    "Cystic"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient has prostate cancer with new-onset back pain and imaging showing spinal lesions. Prostate cancer metastases to bone are characteristically osteoblastic (Option D). This means they stimulate osteoblasts to form new, disorganized bone, appearing as sclerotic (densely white) lesions on radiographs. While some cancers cause osteolytic (bone-destroying) lesions, prostate cancer is known for its osteoblastic bone metastases, which are a hallmark of the disease. Nodular (Option A) and cystic (Option E) are not typical descriptions for bone metastases from prostate cancer. Osteoclastic lesions (Option B) are more common with metastases from other cancers (e.g., multiple myeloma, breast cancer). Mixed osteoblastic-osteoclastic (Option C) lesions are seen in some cancers, but osteoblastic is the predominant pattern for prostate cancer."

She has a history of hyperthyroidism, which has been managed with antithyroid medications for the past two years. Laboratory studies show an elevated alkaline phosphatase level but normal serum calcium and phosphate levels. Radiographs reveal a pattern of trabecular bone loss. The patient is diagnosed with a condition affecting bone remodeling. Which of the following processes is most likely to be increased in this patient's bone remodeling?",
  "choices": [
    "Bone matrix synthesis",
    "Osteoblast activity",
    "Osteoclast activity",
    "Osteocyte apoptosis",
    "Serum calcium resorption"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with generalized bone pain, frequent fractures, elevated alkaline phosphatase (a marker of bone turnover), and trabecular bone loss, along with a history of hyperthyroidism, is consistent with osteitis fibrosa cystica. This condition is a complication of hyperparathyroidism, but the patient's hyperthyroidism history is important here because excess thyroid hormone can also directly stimulate bone resorption. In both hyperthyroidism and hyperparathyroidism, there is excessive bone resorption primarily driven by increased osteoclast activity (Option C). Osteoclasts are cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue. While osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) would increase their activity in response to increased resorption (Option B) to try and compensate, the net effect is bone loss due to the overwhelming osteoclastic activity. Bone matrix synthesis (Option A) and osteocyte apoptosis (Option D) are not the primary drivers of this remodeling pattern. Serum calcium resorption (Option E) is a physiological process, not a 'process in bone remodeling' in the same context as cellular activity."

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient has an autoimmune disease and is on a long-term drug therapy causing side effects like weight gain, increased appetite, mood changes, and concern for osteoporosis. This constellation of side effects is highly characteristic of long-term systemic corticosteroid (glucocorticoid) therapy. Glucocorticoids exert their diverse effects, including immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory actions, by binding to specific intracellular (cytosolic) glucocorticoid receptors. Upon binding, the activated receptor-drug complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA regulatory elements (glucocorticoid response elements - GREs) or interacts with other transcription factors. This binding either activates (increases) or suppresses (decreases) the transcription of target genes, leading to a wide range of cellular responses (Option C). Activation of phospholipase A2 (Option A) is a target *of* glucocorticoids (inhibition), not their primary mechanism. Activation of PKA (Option B) is a mechanism for other hormones. Decreasing cytokine synthesis (Option D) is a *result* of glucocorticoid action, not the direct molecular mechanism. Inhibition of COX-2 (Option E) is the mechanism of NSAIDs, not glucocorticoids."

  "question": "A 68-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer presents with new-onset lower back pain, difficulty walking, and urinary retention. His prostate cancer was initially diagnosed and treated with radical prostatectomy three years ago, but his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels have been gradually rising in recent months. Imaging reveals bony metastases in the lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for the development of bone metastases in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Hematogenous spread of cancer cells from the prostate to bone",
    "Increased secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) by prostate cancer cells",
    "Local extension of prostate cancer into adjacent bone struggles",
    "Lymphatic spread of prostate cancer to regional lymph nodes, followed by dissemination to bone",
    "Tumor-induced osteoblastic activity leading to bone"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient has prostate cancer with new-onset bone metastases in the lumbar vertebrae. Prostate cancer has a well-known propensity to metastasize to bone, particularly the axial skeleton (spine, pelvis). The most common route for distant metastases, including bone metastases, is hematogenous spread (via the bloodstream) (Option A). Prostate cancer cells gain access to the circulation and are carried to distant sites, where they can establish secondary tumors. While prostate cancer bone metastases are often osteoblastic (meaning they stimulate new bone formation, as mentioned in Option E), this describes the *effect* of the metastases on bone, not the *mechanism* by which the cancer cells reached the bone. Local extension (Option C) is uncommon for distant bone metastases. Lymphatic spread (Option D) is common for regional lymph nodes but not the primary route for distant bone metastases. Increased secretion of PTHrP (Option B) is a mechanism for hypercalcemia of malignancy seen in some cancers (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma), but it is not the primary mechanism of bone metastasis itself for prostate cancer."

  "question": "A 65-year-old man presents for routine health screening. He has no symptoms but is at increased risk for prostate cancer due to a family history of the disease. The physician orders a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, and the patient's PSA level is found to be elevated. PSA is a glycoprotein secreted by prostate epithelial cells and is often used as a tumor marker in prostate cancer. Which of the following statement is correct regarding PSA testing?",
  "choices": [
    "Elevated PSA levels can be seen in other conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis.",
    "PSA levels are highly specific for prostate cancer and are rarely elevated in other conditions.",
    "PSA testing is not useful in monitoring treatment response in patients with known prostate cancer.",
    "PSA testing is useful only for monitoring the progression of prostate cancer after prostatectomy.",
    "PSA levels are not elevated in advanced stages of prostate cancer, making it unreliable for diagnosis."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is a valuable tumor marker for prostate cancer, but it is not specific to cancer. Elevated PSA levels can be seen in various benign prostate conditions, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) (Option A). This lack of specificity is a major limitation of PSA screening. Therefore, statements claiming high specificity (Option B) or that elevated PSA is *always* prostate cancer (not an option, but implied by incorrect options) are false. PSA testing is indeed useful for monitoring treatment response in patients with known prostate cancer, both before and after prostatectomy (Options C and D are incorrect, and D is too restrictive). PSA levels are typically elevated in advanced stages of prostate cancer, making it a useful diagnostic and monitoring tool (Option E is incorrect)."

  "question": "A 68-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of proximal muscle pain and stiffness, especially in her shoulders and hips. She reports difficulty rising from a chair, combing her hair, and getting dressed. The pain is worse in the morning and improves with mild activity. She has also experienced unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and low-grade fever. On examination, there is tenderness in the shoulder and pelvic girdles, but no weakness. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is markedly elevated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Fibromyalgia",
    "Polymyalgia rheumatica",
    "Polymyositis",
    "Rheumatoid arthritis",
    "Systemic lupus erythematosus"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient's clinical picture is highly suggestive of Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). PMR typically affects individuals over the age of 50 and is characterized by a 3-month history of proximal muscle pain and stiffness, predominantly in the shoulders and hips. Key features include morning stiffness that improves with activity, constitutional symptoms (unintentional weight loss, fatigue, low-grade fever), tenderness in the affected areas without actual muscle weakness, and a markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Fibromyalgia (Option A) causes widespread pain but typically not significant inflammation or elevated ESR. Polymyositis (Option C) primarily causes muscle weakness, not just pain and stiffness. Rheumatoid arthritis (Option D) primarily affects smaller joints and causes inflammation and deformity. Systemic lupus erythematosus (Option E) presents with a wide array of systemic symptoms, often including rash, photosensitivity, and renal involvement, which are not described here."

  "question": "A 30-year-old primigravida at 9 weeks gestation comes to the emergency department due to pelvic pain. The patient has had intermittent right lower quadrant pain for the last week, but yesterday it became constant and associated with nausea and vomiting. She is taking a prenatal vitamin daily and has no chronic medical conditions. Blood pressure is 122/75 and pulse is 95/min. BMI is 25 kg/m^2. Ultrasound shows an intrauterine fetal pole measuring 9 weeks gestation with cardiac motion at 150/min. There is free fluid in the pelvis, and the right ovary is enlarged with decreased blood flow on Doppler. The patient undergoes emergency laparoscopy for ovarian torsion and the right ovary containing the corpus luteum is removed due to severe necrosis. Postoperative ultrasound shows positive intrauterine fetal cardiac activity. The physician then prescribes the patient progesterone supplementation for 1-week duration. What is the explanation for the physician's reasoning behind prescribing this medication?",
  "choices": [
    "Prevention of pregnancy loss during the luteal-placental shift",
    "Decrease the likelihood of possible uterine contractions after surgery",
    "Prevention of pre-eclampsia development since the patient is now high-risk",
    "Reduce the risk for neural tube defect development in the fetus",
    "Ripen the cervix for abortion of the fetus, as viability is now compromised"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient is 9 weeks pregnant and underwent emergency ovarian torsion surgery, resulting in the removal of the right ovary which contained the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is the primary source of progesterone during the first 7-10 weeks of pregnancy. Around 7-10 weeks, the placenta gradually takes over progesterone production, a process known as the 'luteal-placental shift.' Removal of the corpus luteum before this shift is complete can lead to a sudden drop in progesterone, risking pregnancy loss (miscarriage). Therefore, prescribing progesterone supplementation for 1-week duration is aimed at preventing pregnancy loss during this critical luteal-placental shift (Option A). Options B, C, D, and E describe effects not directly related to the role of the corpus luteum and its removal in early pregnancy."

  "question": "A 16-year old girl is scheduled for termination of an unwanted pregnancy. After she receives counseling and signs the consent form, her blood is drawn for heme profile and typing. The latter reveals she has ORh-negative blood group, and she receives RhoGAM. What is the rationale for the RhoGAM therapy?",
  "choices": [
    "To bind AB isohemagglutinogens in the mother's circulation",
    "To bind Rh+ red blood cells in the mother's circulation",
    "To neutralize AB isohemagglutinins",
    "To neutralize anti-Rh antibodies in the mother's circulation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient is Rh-negative (ORh-) and is undergoing pregnancy termination. RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin) is administered to Rh-negative mothers who are potentially exposed to Rh-positive fetal blood. The rationale for RhoGAM is to prevent the mother from developing anti-Rh antibodies against Rh-positive fetal red blood cells. RhoGAM contains anti-Rh antibodies that bind to and neutralize any Rh+ fetal red blood cells that may have entered the mother's circulation during the termination procedure, preventing the mother's immune system from recognizing these cells and forming her own, long-lasting anti-Rh antibodies. This is crucial for preventing hemolytic disease of the newborn in future Rh-positive pregnancies. Therefore, the rationale is to bind Rh+ red blood cells in the mother's circulation (Option B). Options A, C, and D describe incorrect mechanisms or targets."

  "question": "A 17-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of dysuria that began 8 days ago. The patient went to urgent care a week ago and completed a 7-day course of nitrofurantoin with no relief of symptoms. The patient also complains of vaginal discharge but no fever, chills, or back pain. The patient has had 4 sexual partners in the last 5 months and uses condoms inconsistently. On speculum examination, there is thick, yellow cervical discharge, and the cervix bleeds on contact with a swab. Urinalysis is positive for leukocyte esterase but negative for nitrites and blood. Urine pregnancy test is negative. A cervical swab sent for nucleic acid amplification testing is negative for Chlamydia trachomatis but positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Azithromycin",
    "Ceftriaxone",
    "Azithromycin + Doxycycline",
    "Ceftriaxone + Azithromycin",
    "Doxycycline + Gentamicin"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with symptoms of dysuria, vaginal discharge, and cervical inflammation (thick, yellow discharge, friable cervix). Her sexual history, positive leukocyte esterase on urinalysis (suggesting inflammation), and particularly the positive NAAT for Neisseria gonorrhoeae confirm a diagnosis of gonococcal cervicitis. Given the high co-infection rate of N. gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, and to ensure broad coverage, the recommended treatment for uncomplicated gonococcal infections is dual therapy: a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus a single oral dose of azithromycin (Option D). Although her Chlamydia NAAT was negative, dual therapy is still standard to cover for potential co-infection or incomplete sensitivity. Azithromycin alone (Option A) or Ceftriaxone alone (Option B) would be incomplete. Doxycycline (Option C and E) is effective for Chlamydia but not typically used as first-line for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Gentamicin (Option E) is not a standard first-line treatment for cervicitis."

  "question": "A 17-year-old woman comes to the office for routine physical examination. She feels well and has no concerns. The patient has had three sexual partners for the past 6 months and uses condoms for contraception. She has no significant medical history, takes no medications, and has no drug allergies. Her vitals are stable, and her physical examination and pelvic examination are unremarkable. On bimanual examination, the uterus is small and mobile and has no cervical motion or fundal tenderness. Urine pregnancy test is negative. A cervical swab is sent for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and comes back positive for Chlamydia trachomatis. The patient completes a full course of ceftriaxone and doxycycline and follows up appropriately. Several months later, the patient returns to the clinic with complaints of dysuria. Urinalysis is positive for leukocytes and negative for bacteria. NAAT comes back positive for C. trachomatis. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for re-infection in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Antibiotic resistance",
    "Distinctive serovar contagion",
    "Inadequate immune response",
    "Antigenic variation of pili proteins",
    "Reactivation of dormant hypnozoites"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient was successfully treated for Chlamydia trachomatis but experienced a recurrence of infection with the same pathogen. Given that she has multiple sexual partners and uses condoms inconsistently, the most likely explanation for re-infection is exposure to a new, distinct serovar (strain) of Chlamydia trachomatis (Option B). Unlike some other infections where immunity develops, reinfection with Chlamydia is common, often from untreated partners or new partners. Antibiotic resistance (Option A) is less likely given her initial successful treatment with standard antibiotics. An inadequate immune response (Option C) or antigenic variation of pili proteins (Option D) are less common explanations for direct re-infection in this context. Reactivation of dormant hypnozoites (Option E) describes a mechanism of malaria relapse, which is irrelevant here."

  "question": "A 26-year-old G2P2 at 38 weeks gestational age comes to the emergency room complaining of dizziness and lack of urination. She is obese and markedly edematous. Soon after admission to the hospital, she experienced severe convulsions. Her baby is delivered by emergency cesarean section and the woman recovered her health soon after delivery. The first-line pharmacologic treatment for this condition has which of the following physiologic effects?",
  "choices": [
    "Inhibition of fast Na+ channels in the myocardium",
    "Increase in aldosterone production",
    "Competition with Ca2+ for muscle depolarization",
    "Stimulation of renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels",
    "Arrest of metaphase in mitosis through microtubule destabilization"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient, a G2P2 at 38 weeks gestation, presents with dizziness, lack of urination, marked edema, and severe convulsions (seizures), which resolve after delivery. This is a classic presentation of eclampsia, a severe form of pre-eclampsia with seizures. The first-line pharmacologic treatment for eclampsia is magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate works by competing with calcium (Ca2+) for entry into cells, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and reducing neuromuscular excitability, which helps prevent and control seizures. Thus, its physiological effect is competition with Ca2+ for muscle depolarization (Option C). Inhibition of fast Na+ channels (Option A) is a mechanism of some antiarrhythmics or anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin). Increase in aldosterone production (Option B) is not a desired effect. Stimulation of ROMK channels (Option D) relates to potassium excretion. Arrest of metaphase in mitosis (Option E) describes the mechanism of some chemotherapeutic agents."

She has no significant medical history and her only current medications are a daily prenatal vitamin and daily ranitidine. A 1-hour glucose challenge test done at this visit shows a glucose concentration of 172 mg/dL (N<135) 100-g oral glucose tolerance test shows glucose concentrations of 213 mg/dL (N<180) and 165 mg/dL (N<140) at 1 and 3 hours, respectively. If she does not receive adequate treatment for her condition, her infant is at greatest risk of which of the following complications?",
  "choices": [
    "Restricted growth",
    "Hypoglycemia",
    "Oligohydramnios",
    "Omphalocele",
    "Anemia"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient's 1-hour glucose challenge test (172 mg/dL) and 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (213 mg/dL at 1 hour, 165 mg/dL at 3 hours) indicate gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM occurs when glucose intolerance develops or is first recognized during pregnancy. If left untreated, uncontrolled maternal hyperglycemia leads to fetal hyperglycemia, which stimulates the fetal pancreas to produce excess insulin (fetal hyperinsulinemia). Fetal hyperinsulinemia acts as a growth factor, leading to macrosomia (excessive fetal growth). After birth, the sudden cessation of the high maternal glucose supply, combined with persistent fetal hyperinsulinemia, places the neonate at greatest risk for hypoglycemia (Option B). Restricted growth (Option A) is the opposite of what typically occurs in uncontrolled GDM. Oligohydramnios (Option C) is insufficient amniotic fluid, whereas polyhydramnios is more common in GDM due to increased fetal urination. Omphalocele (Option D) is a congenital abdominal wall defect. Anemia (Option E) is not a direct complication of untreated GDM in the infant."

Her medical history is significant only for a mild allergy to penicillin as a child. A review of her chart reveals a positive GBS swab at 36 weeks. What is the next best step in management?",
  "choices": [
    "Intrapartum IV penicillin",
    "Consult allergy and immunology for desensitization therapy",
    "Intrapartum IV vancomycin",
    "Intrapartum IV cefazolin"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient is a GBS (Group B Streptococcus) positive woman in labor with ruptured membranes. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is indicated to prevent vertical transmission of GBS to the neonate. The first-line antibiotic for GBS prophylaxis is penicillin. However, the patient has a mild penicillin allergy (not severe, immediate hypersensitivity reaction). For patients with a penicillin allergy that is not severe (e.g., rash, not anaphylaxis), cefazolin (a first-generation cephalosporin, Option D) is the recommended alternative for GBS prophylaxis. Intrapartum IV penicillin (Option A) is contraindicated due to the allergy. Consulting allergy/immunology for desensitization (Option B) is not the immediate next step in active labor. Intrapartum IV vancomycin (Option C) is reserved for severe penicillin allergies (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) or GBS isolates resistant to penicillin/cefazolin, which is not indicated by the mild allergy here."

Lab results are as follows: Hgb, 9 g/dL Hct, 25%; reticulocyte count, 18%; bilirubin, 24 mg/dL with direct bilirubin of 1.0 mg/dL. Direct Coombs test is performed, which is likely to reveal which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the baby's serum",
    "Anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the mother's serum",
    "Anti-Rh antibodies bound to the baby's red blood cells",
    "Anti-Rh antibodies bound to the mother's red blood cells",
    "Anti-Rh antibodies present in the mother's circulation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The neonate presents with marked jaundice, anemia (Hgb 9 g/dL, Hct 25%), and elevated reticulocyte count (18%), indicating hemolytic anemia. The mother is Rh-negative (ABRh-), and the baby is Rh-positive (ABRh+). This scenario is classic for Rh alloimmunization (Rh incompatibility). In this condition, the Rh-negative mother has developed anti-Rh antibodies from a previous Rh-positive pregnancy or exposure, and these antibodies have crossed the placenta to attack the Rh-positive fetal red blood cells. A direct Coombs test (also known as direct antiglobulin test - DAT) is performed on the *baby's* red blood cells to detect antibodies (in this case, anti-Rh antibodies) that are already bound to the surface of the baby's red blood cells, which causes their destruction. Therefore, the direct Coombs test is likely to reveal anti-Rh antibodies bound to the baby's red blood cells (Option C). Options A, B, and E describe antibodies in serum or on the mother's cells, not specifically *bound* to the baby's RBCs. Option D is incorrect as the mother's RBCs are Rh-negative and would not have anti-Rh antibodies bound."

She and her partner have been trying to conceive for the past 6 months and they are very excited about the pregnancy. She only has a single right kidney due to renal agenesis and is worried how pregnancy will affect her kidney. Which of the following is a normal physiological change in the renal system during pregnancy?",
  "choices": [
    "Increased bladder tone",
    "Increase in glomerular filtration rate",
    "Increase in serum creatinine",
    "Shrinkage of kidneys due to decreased blood flow",
    "Vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Pregnancy induces significant physiological changes in the renal system to support the mother and the developing fetus. One of the most prominent normal physiological changes in the renal system during pregnancy is an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Option B). This increase, often by 30-50%, begins early in pregnancy and is sustained throughout, leading to a decrease in serum creatinine and BUN (Options C is incorrect). Increased bladder tone (Option A) is not a normal physiological change; rather, smooth muscle relaxation can lead to decreased bladder tone and increased bladder capacity. Kidneys do not shrink (Option D); they can increase slightly in size due to increased vascularity and interstitial volume. Vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles (Option E) would decrease GFR, which is contrary to the physiological changes seen."

  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with lower abdominal pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness, in a sexually active young woman, is classic for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). PID is commonly caused by ascending infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Complications of PID include ectopic pregnancy (due to fallopian tube scarring, Option A), tubo-ovarian abscess (collection of pus in the ovary/fallopian tube, Option B), Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome (perihepatitis, inflammation of liver capsule, Option C), and generalized peritonitis (Option D) if the infection spreads. Cervical cancer (Option E) is primarily caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and is not a direct complication of PID. While there can be an association between STIs and cervical cancer, PID itself does not directly cause cervical cancer."

    "Decreased libido",
    "Osteoporosis",
    "Ovarian cancer",
    "Thrombotic events"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient is a transgender man receiving intramuscular testosterone therapy (masculinizing HRT). While testosterone therapy induces desired virilizing changes, it also carries risks of certain complications. Among the options, thrombotic events (Option D), including venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular events, are a known risk associated with testosterone therapy, particularly with higher doses or in individuals with pre-existing risk factors. Decreased libido (Option A) is typically not a complication of testosterone therapy; in fact, libido usually increases. Osteoporosis (Option B) is more commonly associated with estrogen deficiency, not testosterone therapy. Ovarian cancer (Option C) is not a known direct complication of testosterone therapy. Other significant side effects to monitor for with testosterone therapy include polycythemia, dyslipidemia, and liver injury (though less common with intramuscular forms)."

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with chronic fatigue, difficulty focusing, sleep disturbance (falls asleep during lectures), anhedonia (stopped practicing piano, attending family events, spending time with friends), and a flat affect are highly suggestive of major depressive disorder (MDD). When a patient presents with symptoms of depression, the most important and urgent step in management is to assess for suicidality (Option A). This is a critical safety assessment, as suicidal ideation is a common and dangerous symptom of depression. While consulting psychiatry (Option B) may be necessary for management, it is not the immediate first step. Ordering a CBC (Option C) is a general screening test but not the most urgent diagnostic or safety step for suspected depression. Starting antidepressants like amitriptyline (Option D) or escitalopram (Option E) would be part of treatment, but a suicidality assessment must precede initiation of therapy."

Expected changes include clitoromegaly (Option A), increased acne (Option B), and reduced regularity of menses (often leading to amenorrhea) (Option C). While testosterone can lead to some body fat redistribution, a significant decrease in breast adipose tissue (Option D) is generally *not* an expected change.

    "Feminizing HRT and voice therapy / voice training",
    "There is no treatment that can make her voice higher",
    "Voice therapy / voice training only"

  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient is a transfeminine individual who desires a higher voice but no other physical changes. Feminizing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) primarily affects secondary sex characteristics like fat redistribution, breast development, and skin texture, but it does *not* significantly alter voice pitch. Voice pitch is determined by the vocal cords, which are primarily affected by testosterone during puberty. Therefore, to achieve a higher voice, the best treatment recommendation is voice therapy/voice training only (Option D). This can be provided by a speech therapist and can help patients achieve a more feminine vocal presentation. Feminizing HRT (Options A and B) is not effective for voice feminization.

    "She will not metabolize estrogen as efficiently as she would if she still had her gallbladder."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient is a transfeminine individual about to start oral estrogen HRT and has a history of smoking. It is crucial to discuss how smoking impacts the efficacy of orally administered estrogens. Nicotine consumption can reduce or completely cancel the efficacy of orally administered estrogens due to increased hepatic metabolism (induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes). Therefore, she will not metabolize estrogen as efficiently as she would if she did not smoke cigarettes (Option C). This is an important counseling point for medication efficacy and patient expectations. Option A regarding colonoscopy every three years is incorrect; her colon cancer risk is general and not specifically impacted by estrogen therapy to this extent. Option B regarding flu vaccines is a good general health recommendation but not the most important discussion point *before* starting estrogen therapy related to its metabolism. Option D regarding gallbladder removal is irrelevant to estrogen metabolism."

  "question": "A 14-year-old patient presents to the clinic with their father and a chief complaint of a cough and rhinorrhea. After determining that the cough is caused by nasal secretions irritating the back of the throat and recommending an over-the-counter decongestant, the patient's father mentions that his child has seemed \"down and depressed\" lately, so the physician asks the patient's father to leave the room so you can ask what is wrong. The patient begins to cry and tells the doctor that they have recently discovered that they are most comfortable identifying with a nonbinary gender identity and using they/them pronouns. They haven't spoken about this to anyone yet and don't know \"what to do about any of this\". What is the best response?",
  "choices": [
    "It's common for kids your age to question their gender. Gender identity is fluid, so I wouldn't worry about this because you most likely won't feel the same in a year or two. I am concerned about your depression, however; have you had any thoughts of harming yourself?",
    "Thank you for telling me this; I can tell that it has been worrying you a lot, and I will keep this conversation confidential.

I also have a few questions to ask you about your depression to make sure we take care of that as well.",
    "Why don't we get your dad back in here and maybe he can help? He looked concerned, so I'm sure he'll want to know what's been upsetting you!"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "This scenario presents a sensitive situation where a minor patient is disclosing personal information about gender identity. The best response is to acknowledge their trust, offer support, assure confidentiality (within legal/ethical limits for minors, though this initial statement of support is crucial), provide resources, and then pivot to address the father's initial concern about depression. Option C accomplishes this by thanking the patient for trusting, affirming support, assuring confidentiality, offering resources, and then addressing the depression by asking questions. Option A is dismissive of the patient's gender identity exploration. Option B is unhelpful and inaccurate about what can be done for minors without parental involvement. Option D violates confidentiality and trust by immediately involving the father after the patient explicitly stated they haven't spoken to anyone about it."

  "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician due to feeling fatigued over the past 7 months. She reports having difficulty sleeping and frequently wakes up at night. She has lost 15 pounds over the past several months and is concerned that food is no longer appetizing. Her job performance has declined as she is no longer able to focus on smaller tasks. Vital signs are stable but physical exam is notable for a slowing of speech and sad affect. Upon further questioning you find out that she had gone through a divorce last year and has not seen a physician for the past several years. What is the most important next step?",
  "choices": [
    "Order CBC/CMP",
    "Order TSH levels",
    "Order MRI of the head",
    "Question patient about suicidal ideations",
    "Prescribe Fluoxetine"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance, weight loss, anhedonia, psychomotor slowing, sad affect) following a stressful life event (divorce) are highly suggestive of major depressive disorder. When depression is suspected, the most important and urgent next step is always to screen for suicidal ideations (SI). This is a critical safety assessment. While ordering CBC/CMP (Option A) and TSH levels (Option B) are reasonable steps in a general workup for fatigue and mood changes to rule out medical causes (e.g., hypothyroidism), they are not the *most urgent* step. Ordering an MRI of the head (Option C) is generally not indicated for depression unless neurological deficits are present. Prescribing Fluoxetine (Option E) is a treatment for depression but should only be done after a thorough assessment, including suicidality screening."

  "question": "A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with chest pain, SOB, and diaphoresis. Upon initial questioning he reports that he competes in weightlifting competitions and uses anabolic steroids to enhance his strength. Although his vital signs are stable, PE reveals bilateral gynecomastia and facial acne. ECG reveals nonspecific ST segment changes. He is treated for suspected acute coronary syndrome. After treatment induction, the patient asks the provider if his ACS was due to his steroid use. He also asks what other potential side effects steroids could have on his health in the future. What should the provider respond with?",
  "choices": [
    "No, steroids typically only affect the cardiovascular system",
    "Other complications include polycythemia, testicular atrophy, and liver injury",
    "Other complications include DVTs, Hyperlipidemia, and a reduced prostate volume",
    "Other complications include cholelithiasis, hepatic adenoma, and increased infection risk",
    "No, steroids only affect the cardiovascular system, skin, and liver"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient uses anabolic steroids (exogenous testosterone) and has symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, which is a known cardiovascular complication. The provider should inform the patient about other potential side effects of testosterone use. These include polycythemia (due to increased erythropoietin sensitivity), testicular atrophy (due to negative feedback on LH/FSH), and potential liver injury (though less common with intramuscular forms compared to oral forms). Option A and E are incorrect because steroids affect multiple organ systems beyond just cardiovascular, skin, and liver. Option C incorrectly states reduced prostate volume; testosterone increases prostate volume and can increase prostate cancer risk. Option D incorrectly lists cholelithiasis and hepatic adenoma as testosterone side effects; these are more classically associated with estrogen use."

  "question": "A 36-year-old healthy woman presents to the Family Medicine clinic to establish care. Social history reveals that she is divorced and has a 10-year-old son who lives with his biological father. She lives in a monogamous relationship with her female partner of six years. Her last screening for cervical cancer was done seven years ago. Physical exam is normal, and CMP and CBC are ordered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in her care?",
  "choices": [
    "NAAT for Neisseria gonorrhoeae",
    "NAAT for Chlamydia trachomatis",
    "Pap smear",
    "RPR (rapid plasma reagin) test for Treponema pallidum"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient is a 36-year-old woman whose last cervical cancer screening (Pap smear) was done seven years ago. Current guidelines recommend cervical cancer screening every 3 years with cytology alone for women aged 21-65, or every 5 years with HPV testing alone or co-testing (cytology + HPV) for women aged 30-65. Since her last Pap smear was 7 years ago, she is overdue for screening. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in her care is to perform a Pap smear (Option C). While NAAT for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Option A) and Chlamydia trachomatis (Option B), and RPR for Treponema pallidum (Option D) are important STI screenings, her primary overdue screening is for cervical cancer, especially given her age and sexual history. Her self-reported monogamous relationship does not negate the need for screening based on past history or general guidelines."

  "question": "A 37-year-old man with a known history of HIV infection and IV drug use presents with concern for skin changes on the bilateral lower extremities over the last several weeks. He has recently restarted antiretroviral therapy after being untreated for several years. On exam he is seen to have several elliptical purple papules and plaques on both thighs. These lesions are not painful or pruritic. He also has multiple healing scratches on his left shin that he states are from his cats at home. What is the underlying cause of these skin lesions?",
  "choices": [
    "Vascular damage caused by Bartonella henselae infection",
    "Immune-mediated rash caused by ART",
    "Malignancy caused by herpesvirus infection",
    "Subacute infection by a spirochete infection",
    "Reactivation of a herpesvirus infection"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient has a history of untreated HIV infection and IV drug use (indicating immunosuppression), and presents with characteristic elliptical purple papules and plaques on his lower extremities. These lesions are non-painful and non-pruritic. This clinical picture is classic for Kaposi Sarcoma (KS). Kaposi Sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm caused by Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection (Option C), also known as Kaposi Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV). KS is strongly associated with HIV/AIDS and is considered an AIDS-defining illness. While Bartonella henselae (Option A) causes bacillary angiomatosis (which can appear as vascular lesions), it typically presents as small, papular lesions and is less common to be bilateral and symmetrical, and a cat scratch history would point to focal lesions, not diffuse. Immune-mediated rash from ART (Option B) typically presents as a morbilliform rash. Subacute spirochete infection (Option D) like secondary syphilis (condylomata lata) typically presents with warty, eroded papules. Reactivation of a herpesvirus infection (Option E) like VZV causes herpes zoster (shingles), which follows a dermatomal pattern, not diffuse plaques on bilateral lower extremities."

  "question": "A 27-year-old man with known untreated HIV presents to the ED with fever and chills for the last several days. He also reports a productive cough with green-tinged sputum. Chest x-ray in the ED reveals bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Labs are drawn and reveal the following: WBC 3 x10^3/uL, Segmented 85%, Band Neutrophils 3%, Lymphocyte 10%, Monocyte 1%, Eosinophil 1%, Basophil 0%. Which of the following correctly describes these lab results?",
  "choices": [
    "This patient's leukocytosis is likely attributable to their acute pneumonia",
    "The lymphopenia in this patient is due to destruction of CD3+/CD4+ T cells",
    "Activation of an acute immune response has produced a left shift in leukocyte populations",
    "The lymphopenia in this patient is relative due to an abundance of neutrophils produced to respond to an acute infection",
    "Given the lack of lymphocytosis, this patient likely has bacterial pneumonia"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient has known untreated HIV and presents with fever, chills, cough, and bilateral interstitial infiltrates (suggesting pneumonia). His WBC count is low (3 x10^3/uL), but the differential shows a very low absolute lymphocyte count (10% of 3000 = 300 cells/uL, normal 1500-4000), indicating severe lymphopenia. In patients with untreated HIV, lymphopenia is a hallmark due to the destruction of CD4+ T helper cells by the virus (Option B). This severe immunosuppression puts him at high risk for opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Option A is incorrect because the patient has leukopenia (low WBC count), not leukocytosis. Option C is incorrect as there is no significant left shift (bands are normal at 3%). Option D is incorrect as the lymphopenia is absolute, not relative. Option E is incorrect; while bacterial pneumonia can cause neutrophilia, the overall profound lymphopenia and immunosuppression suggest an opportunistic infection, and the WBC differential alone is not enough to distinguish bacterial from other infections in this severely immunocompromised patient."

  "question": "A 30-year-old transgender man on masculinizing HRT presents to the ED following the sudden onset of pain in his right hand. He reports that he woke up this morning with severe, burning pain in his right hand. Upon physical exam, his hand appears swollen and erythematous. He denies any pertinent past medical history. He recalls that last night he went to bed early after he became very uncomfortable with generalized pruritus after his nightly shower. He is treated appropriately, and follow-up testing is negative for any myeloproliferative neoplasm. Which of the following sets of lab results would be found in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Plasma Volume: Normal, RBC Mass: Increased, O2 Sat: Decreased, EPO: Increased, JAK2 mutation: Negative",
    "Plasma Volume: Increased, RBC Mass: Markedly Increased, O2 Sat: Normal, EPO: Decreased, JAK2 mutation: Positive",
    "Plasma Volume: Normal, RBC Mass: Increased, O2 Sat: Normal, EPO: Increased, JAK2 mutation: Negative",
    "Plasma Volume: Increased, RBC Mass: Normal, O2 Sat: Normal, EPO: Normal, JAK2 mutation: Positive"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient is a transgender man on masculinizing HRT (testosterone). Testosterone therapy is known to cause polycythemia (increased red blood cell mass) due to stimulating erythropoiesis and enhancing erythropoietin sensitivity. This is a form of 'appropriate' absolute polycythemia (or sometimes called secondary polycythemia). In this condition, the RBC mass is increased, oxygen saturation is normal, and erythropoietin (EPO) levels are increased in response to the physiological drive for increased oxygen-carrying capacity (even if not due to hypoxemia in this specific case, it's a direct response to exogenous testosterone or other non-hypoxic stimuli). Plasma volume is typically normal or slightly increased, and JAK2 mutations (characteristic of Polycythemia Vera, a primary myeloproliferative neoplasm) would be negative since this is a secondary polycythemia due to exogenous hormone. Option C correctly matches these findings: Normal plasma volume, increased RBC mass, normal O2 Sat, increased EPO, and negative JAK2 mutation. Option A has decreased O2 Sat, which is inconsistent. Option B describes Polycythemia Vera (increased plasma volume, decreased EPO, positive JAK2). Option D describes relative polycythemia (decreased plasma volume, normal RBC mass) or an unrelated condition."

  "question": "A 13-year-old boy presents to your primary care office with a 3-week history of fatigue and bilateral lower extremity pain. He reports feeling very tired midway through the school day and describes a dull ache in his thighs and knees that worsens with activity (rated 6/10). He has not taken any medications for the pain. His mother notes that he has unintentionally lost weight over the past month. The patient has a past medical history of atopic dermatitis, infectious mononucleosis, cholera, and schistosomiasis. His family recently immigrated from Tanzania. Family history includes hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia in his father, and ovarian cancer in his mother. Upon further questioning, he reports waking up with sweat-soaked bed sheets. His father attributed this to a change in weather. On exam, temperature is 38.2Â°C (100.6Â°F), BP 126/78 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 14 bpm. Physical findings include multiple petechiae on both palms, tenderness and swelling of the right lower jaw, and bilateral lower extremity tenderness. Lab results: Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL, Hematocrit: 27%, WBC: 17,000/mm^3, Platelets: 90,000/mm^3, LDH: 400 U/L (normal: 120-290 U/L). A biopsy is performed.

    "t(14;18)",
    "t(9;22)",
    "t(8;14)",
    "t(11;18)"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's clinical picture is concerning for a hematologic malignancy, specifically Burkitt lymphoma. Key features include: young age (13-year-old boy), recent immigration from Tanzania (a region where endemic Burkitt lymphoma is common, often associated with EBV), B symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, low-grade fever), generalized tenderness and swelling in the right lower jaw and bilateral lower extremities (suggesting bone/marrow involvement), multiple petechiae (suggesting thrombocytopenia), and abnormal lab results (anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH). Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The most common chromosomal translocation associated with Burkitt lymphoma is the t(8;14) translocation (Option D), which involves the c-MYC oncogene on chromosome 8 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. Option A (t(11;22)) is associated with Ewing sarcoma. Option B (t(14;18)) is associated with follicular lymphoma. Option C (t(9;22)) is the Philadelphia chromosome associated with CML. Option E (t(11;18)) is associated with MALT lymphoma."

    "CD69"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "Given the likely diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma (a B-cell lymphoma), the most appropriate immunotherapy target would be a cell surface marker expressed on B cells. CD20 (Option D) is a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of pre-B cells and mature B lymphocytes, but not on hematopoietic stem cells or plasma cells. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab) are highly effective in treating CD20-positive B-cell lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma. CD3 (Option A), CD4 (Option B), and CD8 (Option C) are T-cell markers. CD69 (Option E) is an activation marker on lymphocytes but not a specific target for B-cell lymphoma therapy."

    "Cholera",
    "Schistosomiasis."

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's likely diagnosis is Burkitt lymphoma, particularly the endemic form given his background. Endemic Burkitt lymphoma is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Infectious mononucleosis (Option C) is a clinical manifestation of primary EBV infection. While age (Option A) is a factor (younger age is typical for endemic Burkitt lymphoma), a prior EBV infection is a much stronger and direct predisposing risk factor. Atopic dermatitis (Option B), cholera (Option D), and schistosomiasis (Option E) are not known risk factors for Burkitt lymphoma."

  "question": "A 3rd year medical student has just started the pediatric outpatient rotation in the middle of a flu season. Everyone in the office seems stressed and overworked and sick kids with frazzled parents fill the waiting room. The student walks into Room 2 to see the last patient before lunch. Johnny is a 6-year-old boy brought in by his mom for fever, cough, runny nose, and poor appetite since this morning. His vital signs are as follows: T 37.5Â°C, BP 72/50 mmHg, HR 120/min, RR 22/min, O2 Sat 95% on room air. His mom says \"I just need a prescription for antibiotics so he can go back to school tomorrow.\" She is clearly in a hurry and pressures the student to get the attending so she can return to work. Johnny is the 10th patient today that is being seen with almost the exact same story. Prior to briefing the attending physician, the student takes a moment to think about the case. Considering the risks of availability bias and anchoring bias, what would be the best next step in the care of Johnny?",
  "choices": [
    "Find out if there is anything about this patient that does not fit the pattern of similar patients seen this morning.",
    "Develop a heuristic for patients with influenza and apply it to Johnny.",
    "Inform the attending physician that there is a patient in Room 2 who just needs a prescription for amoxicillin.",
    "Given Johnny's low blood pressure and high heart rate, order a CBC, CMP, CXR, blood cultures and admit to the hospital."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The medical student is experiencing 'availability bias' (over-relying on recent examples, i.e., other flu-like cases) and 'anchoring bias' (sticking to the initial impression that Johnny just needs an antibiotic like the others). To counteract these cognitive biases and ensure patient safety, the best next step is to actively seek out information that might contradict the prevailing pattern or initial diagnosis. Therefore, finding out if there is anything about this patient that does not fit the pattern of similar patients seen this morning (Option A) is the most appropriate step. Developing a heuristic (Option B) would reinforce the bias. Informing the attending physician that the patient just needs amoxicillin (Option C) would be an example of blind obedience and would not allow for thorough evaluation. Ordering extensive tests and admitting the patient (Option D) is an overreaction and not justified by the stable vital signs for a typical viral illness, especially without a specific clinical indication for such aggressive management."

  "choices": [
    "Bedtime NPH insulin is likely to be added to her treatment regimen",
    "Her average insulin levels are likely to be higher than normal",
    "Her identical twin is at high risk for developing type I diabetes",
    "Her identical twin is at low risk for developing type II diabetes",
    "She is at high risk for developing hemochromatosis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient has Type 2 diabetes, which is primarily characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and progressive beta-cell dysfunction. Despite being on metformin, her HbA1c is 6.4%, indicating her glycemic control is not at target. In Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas initially compensates for insulin resistance by increasing insulin production, leading to hyperinsulinemia. Even as beta-cell function declines, endogenous insulin levels may remain relatively high compared to a non-diabetic individual attempting to overcome significant insulin resistance. Therefore, her average insulin levels are likely to be higher than normal (Option B). Option A is incorrect; NPH insulin would be considered if current therapy is insufficient, but it's not the automatic next step. Option C is incorrect; Type 1 diabetes has different risk factors and genetic predisposition compared to Type 2. Option D is incorrect; Type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic component, so her identical twin would be at *high* risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. Option E is incorrect; hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload, not directly linked to Type 2 diabetes risk."

  "question": "A 20-year-old man presents to his physician for evaluation of allergies. He reports that he reliably develops indigestion and belching when eating a \"supreme\" pizza and drinking beer. To check for allergy, the physician obtains blood for measurement of IgE antibodies to wheat flour, yeast, tomato, cheese, meat, and various spices. Test results are negative. The physician orders repeat testing, which is also negative, and sends the patient to an allergist-immunologist for a more detailed evaluation. What is the cognitive error in this scenario?",

    "Affective bias",
    "Anchoring",
    "Availability bias",
    "Blind obedience",
    "Context error"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The physician repeatedly tests for IgE-mediated allergies despite negative results, focusing on a specific diagnosis based on initial symptoms (indigestion/belching after pizza and beer). This scenario most closely illustrates **availability bias** (Option C), where the physician relies on easily recalled or recently encountered examples of allergies (even if not fitting the patient's symptoms well) rather than considering alternative diagnoses. It could also involve anchoring, but the repeated focus on *allergy testing* rather than a single initial diagnosis makes availability bias a better fit. Affective bias (Option A) involves judgments influenced by emotions. Blind obedience (Option D) refers to following authority without question. Context error (Option E) relates to misinterpreting information due to surrounding circumstances."

  "question": "A 41-year-old man is diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. Due to low levels of the liver regulatory protein, hepcidin, in his blood, iron uptake by his intestinal epithelial cells and its release to blood continue unabated. Hepcidin reduces iron entry into blood by blocking the activity of the epithelial cell trans-membrane protein, ferroportin. What is the hypothesized mechanism of this blockade?",
  "choices": [
    "A change in ferroportin primary structure caused by binding to hepcidin",
    "Apoptosis of cells expressing ferroportin",
    "Endocytosis of ferroportin followed by its degradation in lysosomes",
    "Inhibition of co-translational import of ferroportin",
    "Transcription-based reduction in ferroportin synthesis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by iron overload due to low hepcidin. Hepcidin's role is to regulate iron entry into the blood by controlling the activity of ferroportin, the iron exporter on intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages. The hypothesized mechanism by which hepcidin blocks ferroportin's activity is by binding to ferroportin, causing its internalization (endocytosis) and subsequent degradation within lysosomes (Option C). This reduces the number of ferroportin molecules available on the cell surface to export iron, thus decreasing iron release into the blood. Options A, B, D, and E describe different mechanisms (structural change, apoptosis, inhibition of import, reduced synthesis) that are not the primary, hypothesized mechanism of hepcidin-mediated ferroportin regulation."

  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with chronic fatigue, malaise, polyuria (waking up at night to void), polydipsia (thirst), new-onset diabetes (random glucose 268 mg/dL), tanned skin, and hepatomegaly (palpable liver edge) strongly suggests hereditary hemochromatosis. This condition is characterized by iron overload and deposition in various organs, including the skin (leading to 'bronze diabetes'), liver, pancreas, and endocrine glands. To confirm this presumptive diagnosis, the most appropriate next step in evaluation is to order serum iron studies (Option C), which include serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin. These tests would typically show elevated serum iron and ferritin, and high transferrin saturation. CBC with differential (Option A) would provide general hematologic information. A glucose tolerance test (Option B) would confirm diabetes but not its underlying cause. Fasting serum lipids (Option D) are not directly indicated. Urinalysis (Option E) is a general test, but serum iron studies are specific for hemochromatosis."

  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's clinical picture (chronic fatigue, weight loss, loss of libido, tanned skin without tan lines, hepatomegaly, new-onset diabetes with high glucose and HbA1c, elevated liver enzymes) is classic for hereditary hemochromatosis. This condition is characterized by excessive iron deposition in organs. To confirm the diagnosis on a liver biopsy and visualize iron deposits, the most appropriate special stain is Prussian blue stain (also known as Perl's stain) (Option D). Prussian blue stain reacts with ferric iron (Fe3+) to produce a blue color, allowing for the visualization of iron accumulation within hepatocytes and other cells. Gram stain (Option A) is for bacteria. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E, Option B) is a general stain that would show the cellular architecture but not specifically iron. Immunohistochemical stains (Option C) are for specific proteins or antigens. Trichrome stain (Option E) is used to visualize collagen and fibrosis."

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with recurrent seizures, each episode clearly linked to severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose 29-32 mg/dL) that resolves with IV dextrose. The key lab finding is an elevated insulin level with an undetectable C-peptide. C-peptide is co-secreted with endogenous insulin. An undetectable C-peptide with elevated insulin strongly indicates exogenous (administered) insulin. The history of the father's new girlfriend having access to insulin at home points towards factitious hypoglycemia due to inappropriate insulin administration (Option A). An insulin-secreting tumor (insulinoma, Option B) would cause endogenous hyperinsulinemia, but C-peptide levels would be *elevated*, not undetectable. Insulin resistance (Option C) would cause hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. New onset epilepsy (Option D) or an undiagnosed brain tumor (Option E) could cause seizures, but the clear association with severe hypoglycemia and resolution with dextrose points to a metabolic cause, not a primary neurological disorder."

  "question": "A 42-year-old white man presents to the Family Medicine clinic in February with chronic fatigue, lethargy, arthralgia, and a 90-lb unintentional weight loss. He has a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Upon entering the exam room, the physician is struck by the bronze color of the patient's skin. Physical exam reveals no tan lines. A presumptive diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is made. The physician has most likely arrived at the diagnosis by using which of the following models?",
  "choices": [
    "Hypothetico-deductive reasoning",
    "Hypothesis testing",
    "Inverse pattern recognition",
    "Pattern recognition"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The physician arrived at a presumptive diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis based on a constellation of classic signs and symptoms (chronic fatigue, lethargy, arthralgia, weight loss, poorly controlled diabetes, bronze skin without tan lines, and likely hepatomegaly, as often seen). This process, where a physician quickly identifies a disease by recognizing a typical set of clinical features, is called pattern recognition (Option D). It is a form of non-analytic reasoning. Hypothetico-deductive reasoning (Option A) and Hypothesis testing (Option B) involve generating hypotheses and systematically testing them, often used for atypical presentations. Inverse pattern recognition (Option C) is not a standard term."

  "question": "A 55-year-old man presents with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Contributing factors include his morbid obesity and daily consumption of six-pack beer and whiskey. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in addressing the patient's poor dietary habits and excessive alcohol consumption?",
  "choices": [
    "Express an understanding of the difficulties in making dietary changes and stopping alcohol consumption",
    "Make a commitment to support the patient in whatever way necessary to address his obesity and excessive alcohol consumption",
    "Make a list of possible reasonable changes that could be made to improve his diet and stop alcohol use",
    "Spell out the probable medical consequences of continued poor dietary habits and excessive alcohol consumption",
    "Verify the patient's commitment to changing his diet and agreeing to stop alcohol consumption"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient has poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes with significant lifestyle factors (morbid obesity, excessive alcohol consumption). Addressing such complex behavioral issues requires a patient-centered, empathetic approach. The most appropriate first step is to express understanding and empathy for the difficulties involved in making significant lifestyle changes (Option A). This builds rapport, validates the patient's experience, and sets a collaborative tone, which is essential for motivational interviewing. Directly making a commitment to support (Option B) is good but less immediate than expressing understanding. Making a list of changes (Option C) or spelling out consequences (Option D) can be done later, but without initial empathy, they might be met with resistance. Verifying commitment (Option E) is a good step after a discussion, but it's not the initial approach to foster engagement."

  "question": "A 38-year-old man presents to his family physician because of increasing difficulty achieving and maintaining erections. His libido is normal, and screening for depression is negative. Review of systems and past medical history are negative, and he takes no medication. Fasting serum chemistries are normal, except for serum glucose of 155 mg/dL, ALT 76 U/L, AST 65 U/L, and cholesterol 227 mg/dL. CBC is normal. Serum iron is 230 Î¼g/dL and TIBC is 255 g/dL. Which of the following is the most likely underlying physiologic abnormality?",
  "choices": [
    "Increased hepatic synthesis of iron",
    "Increased hepatic synthesis of porphyrins",
    "Increased intestinal absorption of iron",
    "Decreased secretion of iron cations in the distal renal tubules",
    "Impaired incorporation of iron into hemoglobin molecules in the bone marrow"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (erectile dysfunction, normal libido, otherwise healthy), along with elevated serum glucose, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and markedly elevated serum iron (230 Î¼g/dL) with high TIBC (indicating high transferrin saturation), are classic for hereditary hemochromatosis. The primary underlying physiologic abnormality in hereditary hemochromatosis is an inappropriate increase in intestinal absorption of iron (Option C) due to a genetic defect (most commonly in the HFE gene, affecting hepcidin regulation). This leads to excessive iron accumulation in various organs, including the liver (causing elevated LFTs) and testes (leading to hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction). Increased hepatic synthesis of iron (Option A) is incorrect; iron is absorbed, not synthesized. Increased hepatic synthesis of porphyrins (Option B) relates to porphyrias. Decreased secretion of iron cations in the renal tubules (Option D) is not a mechanism of hemochromatosis. Impaired incorporation of iron into hemoglobin (Option E) relates to iron deficiency anemia or sideroblastic anemia, which are different conditions."

  "question": "Which of the following mutations is likely to be detected in first and second-degree relatives of the patient described in the previous question?",
  "choices": [
    "ATP7B mutation on chromosome 13",
    "G280R mutation on chromosome 5",
    "C282T mutation on chromosome 6",
    "N370S on chromosome 1",
    "R83C on chromosome 17"

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The previous question describes a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis. The most common genetic mutation associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (Type 1, HFE-associated) is the C282T mutation on chromosome 6 (Option C) of the HFE gene. This is a common autosomal recessive disorder. Therefore, first and second-degree relatives would be at risk of carrying or expressing this mutation. ATP7B mutation on chromosome 13 (Option A) is associated with Wilson's disease (copper overload). G280R mutation on chromosome 5 (Option B) is not a common mutation for this condition. N370S on chromosome 1 (Option D) is associated with Gaucher disease. R83C on chromosome 17 (Option E) is not a common mutation for this condition."

His blood pressure is 110/85 mmHg, pulse 115; his face is flushed, and he is diaphoretic. Physical exam reveals splenomegaly and a venous pattern on the chest and abdomen. He appears lethargic and disoriented. What is the most likely cause of this patient's bleeding?",
  "choices": [
    "Bronchogenic carcinoma",
    "Deficiency in clotting factors",
    "Eroded gastric ulcer",
    "Protein C deficiency",
    "Portal hypertension"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient has a history of hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. His physical exam findings of splenomegaly and a venous pattern on the chest and abdomen (suggesting collateral circulation, like caput medusae) are classic signs of portal hypertension, which is a major complication of cirrhosis. Coughing up bright red blood (hematemesis) in a patient with portal hypertension is most commonly due to bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, which develop as a consequence of increased pressure in the portal venous system. Therefore, portal hypertension (Option E) is the most likely underlying cause of his bleeding. While liver disease can cause deficiency in clotting factors (Option B), the specific presentation with portal hypertension signs strongly points to variceal bleeding. Bronchogenic carcinoma (Option A) would cause hemoptysis, not typically hematemesis. An eroded gastric ulcer (Option C) is possible but less specific given the signs of portal hypertension. Protein C deficiency (Option D) is a thrombophilia, which would cause clotting, not bleeding."

    "Hypovolemic shock",
    "Shy-Drager syndrome",
    "Vitamin B12 deficiency"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient has a history of hemochromatosis leading to cirrhosis (implied by splenomegaly, portal hypertension signs) and presents with mental confusion, lethargy, and disorientation. This is a classic presentation of hepatic encephalopathy (Option B), a neuropsychiatric complication of severe liver dysfunction. Hepatic encephalopathy is primarily caused by the accumulation of neurotoxins, mainly ammonia, which the damaged liver fails to detoxify. While hemochromatosis can rarely lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), brain metastasis from HCC (Option A) would be less common as the primary cause of acute confusion. Hypovolemic shock (Option C) could cause confusion but is less likely to be the *most likely* cause given the underlying liver disease and the absence of overt severe hypotension, although some dehydration might coexist. Shy-Drager syndrome (Option D) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder. Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option E) can cause neurological symptoms, but not typically acute confusion with signs of severe liver disease."

  "question": "A 58-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus has been prescribed sitagliptin in addition to her current regimen of metformin. Her physician explains that sitagliptin will help improve her blood glucose levels by a specific mechanism of action. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of sitagliptin?",
  "choices": [
    "Inhibits intestinal alpha-glucosidase, delaying carbohydrate absorption",
    "Activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma)",
    "Stimulates insulin release from pancreatic beta cells independent of blood glucose levels",
    "Inhibits the degradation of incretin hormones, thereby increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion",
    "Blocks sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) in the proximal renal tubules, reducing glucose reabsorption"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 is an enzyme responsible for the rapid degradation of incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). By inhibiting DPP-4, sitagliptin increases the circulating levels of active incretin hormones. These elevated incretin levels then enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells and suppress glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, ultimately leading to improved blood glucose control (Option D). Option A describes alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose). Option B describes thiazolidinediones (TZDs, e.g., pioglitazone). Option C describes sulfonylureas (e.g., glyburide). Option E describes SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., canagliflozin)."

He is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and is started on metformin. Which of the following best describes the primary mechanism of action of metformin?",
  "choices": [
    "Increases insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells",
    "Decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases peripheral glucose uptake",
    "Inhibits the enzyme DPP-4, increasing incretin levels",
    "Blocks glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules",
    "Activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), enhancing insulin sensitivity"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient has Type 2 diabetes and is being started on metformin. Metformin is a biguanide that is considered first-line pharmacotherapy for Type 2 diabetes. Its primary mechanism of action involves decreasing hepatic glucose production (gluconeogenesis) and improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (e.g., muscle, adipose tissue), leading to increased glucose uptake and utilization. This helps lower blood glucose levels without significantly increasing insulin secretion or causing hypoglycemia as monotherapy (Option B). Option A describes sulfonylureas. Option C describes DPP-4 inhibitors like sitagliptin. Option D describes SGLT2 inhibitors. Option E describes thiazolidinediones."

Over the past week or two he has had pain in his left knee and ankle and right wrist and has often felt hot. He has lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks. A serum HIV antibody test was negative 12 months previously. Examination reveals a temperature of 37.8Â°C, normal joints, mild abdominal tenderness and an anal fissure. He has mild leukocytosis (12,000/mm^3) and stool positive for WBCs. Sigmoidoscopy shows multiple aphthous mucosal erosions but otherwise normal mucosa. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Ulcerative colitis",
    "Crohn's disease",
    "Cryptosporidiosis",
    "Isospora belli infection",
    "Chlamydia proctitis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain, constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss), peripheral arthritis (left knee, ankle, right wrist pain), and an anal fissure. Sigmoidoscopy shows aphthous mucosal erosions, which are characteristic of Crohn's disease. While stool is positive for WBCs (indicating inflammation) and HIV is negative (ruling out common opportunistic infections in AIDS), the combination of chronic inflammatory GI symptoms, extraintestinal manifestations (arthritis, anal fissure), and aphthous erosions strongly points to Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis (Option A) primarily affects the colon, typically presents with continuous inflammation, and often lacks perianal disease and prominent aphthous erosions, as well as being less commonly associated with small bowel or upper GI involvement. Cryptosporidiosis (Option C) and Isospora belli infection (Option D) are parasitic infections that cause diarrhea, especially in immunocompromised individuals, but are less likely given the chronic nature, extraintestinal manifestations, and negative HIV test from 12 months prior. Chlamydia proctitis (Option E) would primarily cause rectal symptoms but not the systemic or upper GI features seen here."

  "question": "A 15-year-old female athlete sees her pediatrician for cramping abdominal pain of 6 weeks duration. The pain is associated with 5 or more poorly formed stools per day, often mixed with mucus and blood. No one else in the family is sick. She has not traveled outside of her county and has not had any episodes of nausea or vomiting. A stool culture for bacterial pathogens is negative. What is the next most appropriate step in the evaluation of this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "A repeat stool culture",
    "A colonoscopy with biopsies",
    "Assays for ASCA and Anti-OmpC",
    "An empiric trial of loperamide",
    "An empiric trial of corticosteroid therapy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (cramping abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea with mucus and blood for 6 weeks, lack of travel or other sick contacts) are highly suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since stool cultures for bacterial pathogens are negative, an infectious cause is less likely. The most appropriate next step for definitive diagnosis of IBD (either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) is a colonoscopy with biopsies (Option B). This allows for direct visualization of the colonic mucosa and histological examination to confirm inflammation, determine its pattern (continuous vs. skip lesions), and identify specific features of IBD. A repeat stool culture (Option A) is unlikely to yield new information given the chronicity and initial negative result. Assays for ASCA (Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies) and Anti-OmpC (Option C) are serologic markers that can support an IBD diagnosis (ASCA more common in Crohn's, p-ANCA in UC) but are not definitive diagnostic tests and do not replace endoscopy for initial diagnosis. Empiric trials of loperamide (Option D) or corticosteroids (Option E) should not precede a definitive diagnosis, especially with bloody stools, as they can mask symptoms or be inappropriate for certain etiologies."

  "question": "A 28-year-old man has frequent constipation alternating with diarrhea. He often has abdominal pain that is relieved with defecation. He has noticed mucus in his stool but denies the presence of blood. He experiences lower abdominal pain and bloating when under stress. Physical exam, CBC, and ESR are normal. Stool is negative for leukocytes, ova and parasites. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Absence of myenteric ganglia in the distal colon",
    "Chronic infection with C. difficile",
    "Cryptitis with neutrophilic infiltration",
    "Hypersensitivity of afferent enteric nerves",
    "Transmural inflammation of the ileum"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (alternating constipation and diarrhea, abdominal pain relieved by defecation, mucus in stool, pain/bloating under stress, normal physical exam and labs, negative stool studies) are classic for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder without identifiable structural or biochemical abnormalities. The pathogenesis of IBS is complex and is thought to involve a heightened visceral pain perception, which is attributed to hypersensitivity of afferent enteric nerves (Option D). Absence of myenteric ganglia (Option A) describes Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder of motility. Chronic C. difficile infection (Option B) would likely present with positive stool leukocytes and a clear infectious history. Cryptitis with neutrophilic infiltration (Option C) and transmural inflammation of the ileum (Option E) are histological findings characteristic of inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, respectively), which are excluded by the normal physical exam, labs, and stool studies."

  "question": "Flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed on the patient described in the preceding question. What is the most likely finding?",
  "choices": [
    "Diverticula",
    "Normal appearing mucosa",
    "Skip areas of mucosal inflammation",
    "Pseudomembranous colitis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The preceding question describes a patient with symptoms consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional disorder, meaning there are no detectable structural or inflammatory changes in the bowel. Therefore, a flexible sigmoidoscopy in a patient with IBS would most likely reveal normal appearing mucosa (Option B). Diverticula (Option A) are outpouchings of the colonic wall, typically seen in diverticular disease, not IBS. Skip areas of mucosal inflammation (Option C) are characteristic of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. Pseudomembranous colitis (Option D) is typically caused by Clostridium difficile infection and would show characteristic plaques on the mucosa, which is ruled out by the negative stool studies and clinical picture of IBS."

Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with normal bowel sounds throughout. No masses are palpated. Labs are negative for microbial pathogens. A colonoscopy reveals continuous inflammation and ulceration, and a biopsy shows mucosal inflammation and crypt abscesses. Which of the following drugs should be used for the long-term management of this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Ibuprofen",
    "Mesalamine",
    "Methotrexate",
    "Prednisone",
    "Ranitidine"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with chronic bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, continuous inflammation and ulceration on colonoscopy, and mucosal inflammation with crypt abscesses on biopsy is classic for Ulcerative Colitis (UC). For long-term management of mild-to-moderate UC, 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) like mesalamine (Option B) are the first-line agents. Ibuprofen (Option A) is an NSAID, which can worsen IBD symptoms and should generally be avoided. Methotrexate (Option C) is an immunosuppressant used for more severe or refractory IBD, typically Crohn's disease, but is not first-line for UC. Prednisone (Option D) is a corticosteroid used for inducing remission in acute flares of IBD, not for long-term maintenance due to significant side effects. Ranitidine (Option E) is an H2-blocker used for acid suppression, irrelevant for UC."

  "question": "A 7-year-old girl is diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The family is informed that this illness is likely to be of a chronic nature, with episodic flare-ups. How might this impact upon this family and patient from a psychosocial perspective?",
  "choices": [
    "The family will initially pull closer, increasing their protectiveness of the patient, likely leading to some tensions as the child matures and desires additional independence.",
    "Families characteristically deny and minimize the initial impact of a child's disease.",
    "The family will likely ignore medical instructions until physicians and nurses request their involvement.",
    "The child will increase disruptive behavior, as a way of acting out, thereby increasing the family's blame of the child for her condition.",
    "The family will \"doctor shop\" seeking to find another provider who might render a different diagnosis."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "When a child is diagnosed with a chronic illness like ulcerative colitis, families often respond with increased protectiveness and heightened concern for the child's well-being. This initial protective response, while well-intentioned, can lead to tensions as the child grows older and naturally seeks more independence, creating conflicts between the child's developmental needs and the family's desire to manage a chronic condition. Options B, C, D, and E describe less common or less typical initial psychosocial responses. While denial (B) or non-adherence (C) can occur, they are not characteristic initial responses across all families. Disruptive behavior (D) or 'doctor shopping' (E) are not universal reactions and are less representative of the initial family dynamic described for chronic illness management."

Fecal leukocyte test is negative. Stool Na is 50 mEq/L, K is 40 mEq/L and osmolality is 280 mosmol. Which cause of diarrhea is most consistent with these findings?",
  "choices": [
    "Ingestion of sorbitol-containing medication",
    "Clostridium difficile infection",
    "Ulcerative colitis",
    "Shigellosis",
    "Gastrin-secreting tumor"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with diarrhea and abdominal cramping but notably lacks fever, blood in stool, and fecal leukocytes, suggesting a non-inflammatory cause. The stool osmolality (280 mosmol) is close to plasma osmolality, and the stool Na+ (50 mEq/L) and K+ (40 mEq/L) concentrations (sum of ~90 mEq/L) result in a significant osmotic gap when compared to stool osmolality (290 - 2 * (50+40) = 110 mOsm/kg). An osmotic gap >50 mOsm/kg is characteristic of osmotic diarrhea. Osmotic diarrhea is caused by the presence of non-absorbable solutes in the intestinal lumen that draw water into the lumen. Ingestion of sorbitol-containing medication (Option A) is a common cause of osmotic diarrhea. Clostridium difficile infection (Option B) typically causes inflammatory diarrhea with fever, and often positive fecal leukocytes. Ulcerative colitis (Option C) is an inflammatory bowel disease presenting with bloody diarrhea. Shigellosis (Option D) is an invasive bacterial infection causing inflammatory, often bloody, diarrhea. A gastrin-secreting tumor (Option E, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome) causes secretory diarrhea, which would have a low osmotic gap."

Thirty-six hours later she experiences nausea and abdominal cramps followed by profuse watery diarrhea without blood or pus in it. She is afebrile. Her symptoms are most likely due to the action of an A-B toxin that is known for which of the following mechanisms of action?",
  "choices": [
    "Has a K+/Na+ ATP-ase activity",
    "Inactivates 60S ribosomal subunit",
    "Has an N-glycosidase activity",
    "Inactivates the elongation factor 2 (EF-2)",
    "Has an ADP-ribosylating activity"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient's travel history (Cancun, Mexico, street vendor food/drink), acute onset (36 hours), and profuse watery diarrhea without blood, pus, or fever are classic for traveler's diarrhea, most commonly caused by Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). ETEC produces two main toxins: Heat-labile toxin (LT) and Heat-stable toxin (ST). LT is an A-B toxin that has ADP-ribosylating activity (Option E). It ADP-ribosylates the Gs alpha subunit, leading to activation of adenylate cyclase and increased intracellular cAMP, which results in increased chloride secretion and water efflux into the intestinal lumen. Options A, B, C, and D describe mechanisms of other toxins or enzymes: K+/Na+ ATP-ase activity (Option A) is not a primary mechanism of these toxins. Inactivation of 60S ribosomal subunit (Option B) and N-glycosidase activity (Option C) describe Shiga toxin (e.g., EHEC) and Shiga-like toxins, which cause bloody diarrhea and often HUS. Inactivation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) (Option D) describes diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A."

  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "Crohn's disease most commonly affects the terminal ileum. The terminal ileum, along with the entire small intestine (except for the proximal duodenum), receives its blood supply from branches of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The superior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta and supplies the midgut structures, which include the small intestine (jejunum and ileum), ascending colon, and proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. The celiac trunk (Option B) supplies the foregut (stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, proximal duodenum). The inferior mesenteric artery (Option C) supplies the hindgut (distal one-third of transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum). The common iliac artery (Option D) supplies the lower limbs and pelvic structures, not directly the ileum. 'Anterior fecal artery' (Option E) is not a recognized major arterial supply to the GI tract."

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient is diagnosed with lactose intolerance, meaning he cannot digest lactose. Undigested lactose in the intestinal lumen acts as an osmotically active solute, drawing water into the lumen and leading to osmotic diarrhea (Option C). Osmotic diarrhea is characterized by an osmotic gap (stool osmolality - 2 * (stool Na + stool K) > 50 mOsm/kg) and typically resolves with fasting. Exudative diarrhea (Option A) involves inflammation and exudation of fluid, blood, and protein. Motility diarrhea (Option B) is due to abnormal bowel motility (e.g., hyperthyroidism, IBS).

  "explanation": "The patient presents with severe watery diarrhea, fever, dehydration (low skin turgor, hypotension, tachycardia). The stool osmotic gap is 40 mosm. A stool osmotic gap of less than 50 mOsm/kg is characteristic of secretory diarrhea (Option D). Secretory diarrhea results from active secretion of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen, often by bacterial toxins (e.g., cholera, ETEC) or certain tumors (e.g., VIPoma). It does not resolve with fasting and has a low osmotic gap because the excess fluid is due to active secretion, not unabsorbed solutes.

  "explanation": "The question asks for findings more suggestive of ulcerative colitis (UC) over Crohn's disease (CD). Crypt abscesses (neutrophilic infiltration of crypts) seen on histopathology, especially from a rectal biopsy, are a characteristic feature of ulcerative colitis (Option C). While crypt abscesses can be seen in other forms of acute colitis, they are a hallmark of UC and are less common or absent in CD. Enterocutaneous fistulas (Option A), areas of inflammation interrupted by normal mucosa ('skip lesions') (Option B), non-caseating granulomas on biopsy (Option D), and a cobblestone appearance of the mucosa (Option E) are all characteristic features of Crohn's disease, not ulcerative colitis."

  "question": "A 9-year-old boy presents with a 4-month history of intermittent bloody diarrhea associated with 5-8 large stools per day, sometimes containing visible mucus, and low-grade fever. He has lost 8 pounds and is fatigued. Blood tests demonstrate a mild normochromic, normocytic anemia, positive FANA, and elevated serum IgG and IgA. His parents agree to a colonoscopy, and biopsy samples are taken from his rectum and descending colon. Which of the following immune cells is characteristically found in crypt abscesses and in crypt epithelial layer in ulcerative colitis (and several other forms of acute colitis), but is not present in significant numbers in lamina propria of normal colon?",
  "choices": [
    "B-lymphocyte",
    "Dendritic cell",
    "Eosinophil",
    "Neutrophil",
    "Plasma cell"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with chronic bloody diarrhea, mucus, fever, weight loss, fatigue, and systemic inflammatory markers, along with colonoscopy and biopsy findings, is consistent with ulcerative colitis. The question specifically asks about the immune cell characteristically found in crypt abscesses and the crypt epithelial layer in ulcerative colitis. Neutrophils (Option D) are the primary immune cells found infiltrating crypts to form crypt abscesses in acute inflammation of the colon, characteristic of ulcerative colitis and other acute colitides. B-lymphocytes (Option A), dendritic cells (Option B), eosinophils (Option C), and plasma cells (Option E) are present in the normal lamina propria or in other inflammatory conditions but are not the characteristic infiltrating cells forming crypt abscesses in UC."

She also reports that sexual intercourse has been very painful for her recently, and she has malodorous/fecal vaginal discharge. Which of the following should be suspected?",
  "choices": [
    "Shigella dysentery",
    "Salmonellosis",
    "Crohn disease",
    "Ulcerative colitis",
    "Irritable bowel syndrome"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, painful sexual intercourse, and malodorous/fecal vaginal discharge. This constellation of symptoms, particularly the severe perianal/vaginal involvement leading to painful intercourse and discharge, is highly suggestive of Crohn's disease (Option C), which can present with transmural inflammation and fistulizing disease involving the perineum and rectovaginal area. Shigella dysentery (Option A) and Salmonellosis (Option B) are acute bacterial infections causing bloody diarrhea, but they typically don't cause chronic perianal/vaginal discharge or fistulas. Ulcerative colitis (Option D) typically presents with continuous colonic inflammation and bloody diarrhea but generally does not involve fistulas or perianal disease in the same way as Crohn's. Irritable bowel syndrome (Option E) is a functional disorder and would not present with bloody diarrhea, fever, or perianal discharge."

  "question": "A 19-year-old woman presents to the Student Health Center with complaints of frequent, small volume, blood-streaked stools, and abdominal cramps. Her travel history includes a recent mission trip to Haiti where she worked in an orphanage. A week later, her roommate presents with similar symptoms. Their stool cultures are positive for a bacterial pathogen known to resist stomach acid and thus have a low ID50. Both the patient and her roommate recover after completing a course of ciprofloxacin. Which of the following should be suspected?",
  "choices": [
    "Salmonella enterica",
    "Entamoeba histolytica",
    "Enterotoxigenic E. coli",
    "Shigella dysenteriae",
    "Vibrio cholerae"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with frequent, small volume, blood-streaked stools and abdominal cramps, coupled with a travel history to an area with poor sanitation (Haiti, orphanage), and similar symptoms in a roommate, suggests a bacterial dysentery. The key clue is the mention of a bacterial pathogen known to resist stomach acid and have a low ID50 (infectious dose 50%). This is highly characteristic of Shigella dysenteriae (Option D). Shigella species are highly acid-resistant, meaning only a small number of organisms are needed to cause infection, and they cause invasive dysentery. Salmonella enterica (Option A) can cause inflammatory diarrhea but is less acid-resistant. Entamoeba histolytica (Option B) is a protozoan causing amebic dysentery, but the question specifies a bacterial pathogen. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC, Option C) causes watery traveler's diarrhea, not bloody dysentery. Vibrio cholerae (Option E) causes profuse watery diarrhea ('rice-water stools') and is not typically associated with bloody stools or high acid resistance."

  "question": "Annie is a 10-year-old child who has recently been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Meeting with Annie and her parents, which of the following points should be emphasized by the physician in discussing her illness, associated treatments, and overall management?",
  "choices": [
    "Although there is no cure for ulcerative colitis, scientists are making significant progress in understanding pathophysiology of the disease and developing appropriate drugs.",
    "Adherence to the treatment regimen is critical, so parents should teach Annie to take responsibility for taking her medications each day.",
    "Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis can be triggered by psychosocial stress; therefore, the family should protect the child from stressors that might trigger flare-ups of the illness.",
    "Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease that is best managed by the collaborative efforts of the patient, parents, and the medical team.",
    "Ulcerative colitis has a significant impact on cognitive functioning and school performance; therefore, periodic assessment of her intelligence and academic achievement will need to be conducted."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease requiring long-term management. The most appropriate emphasis in discussing chronic illness with a pediatric patient and their family is the importance of a collaborative approach involving the patient, parents, and medical team (Option D). This fosters shared decision-making, empowerment, and better adherence to complex treatment plans. While progress in research (Option A) is true, it's not the most direct communication point for managing the immediate illness. Adherence (Option B) is crucial, but framing it as the parents teaching the child to take responsibility might be too strong for initial communication, and a collaborative approach is more empowering. While stress can influence disease course (Option C), framing it as needing to 'protect the child from stressors' is an oversimplification and can lead to excessive family burden and guilt; stress management is part of coping, not absolute avoidance. There is no evidence that ulcerative colitis has a significant impact on cognitive functioning or requires intelligence/academic assessment (Option E)."

  "question": "An 8-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with lower limb weakness and paresthesia. The weakness started in her feet yesterday and has since begun to involve the entire lower extremity. Three weeks ago, the patient was seen in the emergency department for bloody diarrhea after she returned from a trip to Costa Rica. Which of the following is a characteristic of the pathogen responsible for this patient's presentation?",
  "choices": [
    "Catalase positive",
    "Oxidase positive",
    "Urease positive",
    "Presence of shiga-like toxin",
    "Flagellar motility"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient's acute ascending paralysis (lower limb weakness progressing to entire lower extremity, paresthesias) following a diarrheal illness (bloody diarrhea 3 weeks prior after travel to Costa Rica) is highly suggestive of Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS). GBS is a post-infectious autoimmune neuropathy often triggered by Campylobacter jejuni infection, which commonly causes bloody diarrhea. Campylobacter jejuni is a Gram-negative, S-shaped or comma-shaped rod that is characterized by its flagellar motility (Option E), which enables it to colonize the gut. It is also oxidase positive (Option B). Catalase positive (Option A) is a less specific characteristic. Urease positive (Option C) is characteristic of Helicobacter pylori. Presence of shiga-like toxin (Option D) is characteristic of Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), but not typically GBS."

He is allergic to penicillin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an ulcerated wound: (Image accessed via StatPearls). Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Prednisone",
    "Infliximab",
    "NSAIDs",
    "Cyclophosphamide",
    "Clindamycin"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient has ulcerative colitis and presents with a painful, ulcerated forearm lesion. This clinical scenario, particularly the image (if provided) showing a deep, undermined, often purulent ulcer with violaceous borders, is highly suggestive of Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG). Pyoderma Gangrenosum is an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis. PG is an inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis, and the first-line treatment for active pyoderma gangrenosum, especially when associated with IBD, involves systemic corticosteroids like prednisone (Option A). Infliximab (Option B) is a TNF-alpha inhibitor, a biologic agent used for more severe or refractory IBD and sometimes for PG that is unresponsive to steroids. NSAIDs (Option C) can exacerbate IBD and are not used for PG. Cyclophosphamide (Option D) is a potent immunosuppressant, generally reserved for severe, refractory cases of autoimmune conditions. Clindamycin (Option E) is an antibiotic, and while the lesion is ulcerated, PG is primarily inflammatory and not a bacterial infection, so antibiotics are not the primary treatment unless secondary infection is present."

  "question": "A 6-year-old girl is admitted to the internal medicine floor due to severe generalized abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea for two days duration. She has not traveled anywhere over the past three months because her family got a new dog, and she does not remember eating any undercooked meat. Her past medical history and family history are unremarkable. Vital signs are significant for a T of 38.6Â°C. Stool cultures reveal microaerophilic, comma-shaped organisms. What complication is this patient at the biggest risk of developing?",
  "choices": [
    "An enlarged inflammatory colon",
    "Hemolytic uremic syndrome",
    "Erythematous skin lesions",
    "Nerve demyelination",
    "No likely serious complications"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with acute bloody diarrhea, fever, and severe abdominal pain. The stool cultures reveal microaerophilic, comma-shaped organisms. This description is highly characteristic of Campylobacter jejuni infection. Given the history of a new pet dog (a common vector for C. jejuni), this diagnosis is strongly supported. A serious complication associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, particularly acute enterocolitis, is Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS). GBS is an acute demyelinating polyneuropathy characterized by ascending paralysis and is caused by molecular mimicry. Therefore, the patient is at biggest risk of developing nerve demyelination (Option D), which is the underlying pathology of GBS. Option A (enlarged inflammatory colon/toxic megacolon) can be a complication of severe C. difficile or UC, but not typically Campylobacter. Option B (Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome - HUS) is a serious complication primarily associated with Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC, especially O157:H7), which are rod-shaped, not comma-shaped. Option C (Erythematous skin lesions) can occur in other IBDs or Yersinia, but not primarily Campylobacter. Option E is incorrect as GBS is a serious complication."

  "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the medical center on a cruise ship with an extremely painful leg rash that started 18 hours ago. He is currently on vacation on a Royal Caribbean cruise, where he reports cutting his toe on the beach in the Bahamas two days prior. He is unable to provide his medical history at this time, but his wife reports that has had \"liver issues\" due to his extensive drinking history. Vital signs are significant for a T of 38.8Â°C. Physical examination reveals a purulent puncture wound on the right foot and erythematous swelling extending from the lesion to the proximal aspect of the ankle. The area is exquisitely tender to palpation, and the patient is unable to move his right ankle or foot. The left lower extremity shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms?",
  "choices": [
    "Vibrio parahaemolyticus",
    "Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (E. coli O157:H7)",
    "Vibrio vulnificus",
    "Enterotoxigenic E. coli",
    "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with a rapidly progressive, extremely painful leg rash, purulent wound, and cellulitis following a puncture wound in ocean water (beach in the Bahamas) in a patient with underlying liver disease (due to extensive drinking history) is highly characteristic of infection with Vibrio vulnificus (Option C). V. vulnificus is a Gram-negative bacterium found in warm brackish or saltwater. It can cause severe wound infections (cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis) that are particularly aggressive and life-threatening in individuals with chronic liver disease, often leading to sepsis and death. Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Option A) is typically associated with gastroenteritis from seafood, not wound infections or cellulitis. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC, Option B) and Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC, Option D) are causes of diarrheal illness, not skin infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Option E) can cause skin infections, including cellulitis, but the specific context of ocean water exposure and underlying liver disease makes V. vulnificus a more likely and dangerous pathogen."

  "choices": [
    "Provide detailed medical jargon to ensure an understanding of the severity of the disease.",
    "Tell the patient about potential complications and mortality rates to motivate adherence to treatment.",
    "Use age-appropriate language and visuals to explain the condition and the importance of treatment compliance.",
    "Avoid discussing the prognosis to prevent unnecessary stress on the child.",
    "Focus solely on medical interventions without addressing lifestyle changes."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "When communicating with a child diagnosed with a chronic illness like ulcerative colitis, it is crucial to use age-appropriate language and visuals to ensure understanding. Explaining the condition in a way the child can comprehend and emphasizing the importance of treatment compliance in a positive, empowering manner (Option C) is the most appropriate approach. This aligns with principles of patient-centered communication and shared decision-making. Providing detailed medical jargon (Option A) would be overwhelming and counterproductive. Focusing solely on potential complications and mortality rates (Option B) can be frightening and may not effectively motivate adherence, especially without proper context and empathy. Avoiding discussion of prognosis (Option D) is generally not best practice, as patients and families have a right to information, which should be delivered sensitively and gradually. Focusing solely on medical interventions without lifestyle changes (Option E) is incomplete, as lifestyle adjustments are often critical in managing chronic conditions."

  "question": "A 37-year-old patient presents with diarrhea of two-months duration. She says it improves with fasting and worsens after she eats her croissant for breakfast. She reports that her stool has no blood or mucus but is foul-smelling and floats. Which of the following types of diarrhea is most likely present?",
  "choices": [
    "Malabsorption-induced diarrhea",
    "Osmotic diarrhea",
    "Secretory diarrhea",
    "Inflammatory diarrhea",
    "Infection-induced diarrhea"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (chronic diarrhea, improvement with fasting, worsening after eating a specific food (croissant, which contains fat and carbohydrates), foul-smelling and floating stools) are highly suggestive of malabsorption. Floating stools (steatorrhea) specifically indicate the presence of unabsorbed fat in the stool, which is a hallmark of fat malabsorption. Therefore, malabsorption-induced diarrhea (Option A) is the most likely type. While malabsorption can cause an osmotic component to diarrhea, 'malabsorption-induced' is the more encompassing and specific description given the overall clinical picture. Osmotic diarrhea (Option B) is caused by non-absorbable solutes and improves with fasting but doesn't necessarily present with foul-smelling, floating stools. Secretory diarrhea (Option C) is characterized by a low osmotic gap and does not improve with fasting. Inflammatory diarrhea (Option D) and Infection-induced diarrhea (Option E) typically involve blood or mucus in the stool and positive fecal leukocytes, which are absent here."

Microscopic exam of the stool reveals these organisms: (Image provided showing Giardia trophozoites/cysts). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Cryptosporidium parvum",
    "Cyclospora cayetanensis",
    "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)",
    "Entamoeba histolytica",
    "Giardia intestinalis"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with acute diarrhea, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and describes his stools as soft, frothy, and greasy. He has a history of drinking fresh water from a lake, which is a common source of parasitic infections. The description of greasy, frothy stools points to steatorrhea (fat malabsorption). The microscopic exam of the stool (image, if shown, would typically be Giardia trophozoites or cysts) confirms the presence of Giardia intestinalis (Option E). Giardia infection leads to malabsorption and diarrhea, characterized by steatorrhea, gas, and bloating. Cryptosporidium parvum (Option A) and Cyclospora cayetanensis (Option B) are also waterborne parasites causing watery diarrhea, but Giardia is specifically associated with greasy stools and the depicted morphology. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC, Option C) is a bacterial cause of watery traveler's diarrhea. Entamoeba histolytica (Option D) causes bloody dysentery and often shows ingested erythrocytes on microscopy, not typically greasy stools."

She reports intermittent fevers but no vomiting, tenesmus, or rectal pain. Patient has no serious medical conditions and takes no medications. Patient has not had any recent sick contacts or travel history. Lab evaluation shows WBC count of 15,200/mm^3 and ESR of 44 mm/h. Results of stool exam for occult blood and cultures are negative. CT abdomen shows transmural thickening and surrounding fat stranding in discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon. A colonoscopy is performed, and biopsies of the affected areas are taken. Which of the following is most specific to the patients most likely diagnosis?",

    "Inflammation of the mucosa and submucosa",
    "Intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies",
    "Neutrophilic inflammation of crypts",
    "Non-caseating granulomas",

  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with chronic abdominal pain, non-bloody diarrhea, intermittent fevers, elevated WBC and ESR, and CT findings of transmural thickening and fat stranding in discrete regions ('skip lesions') of the terminal ileum and transverse colon, along with negative stool cultures and occult blood, is highly characteristic of Crohn's disease (CD). Among the histological options, non-caseating granulomas (Option D) are highly specific for Crohn's disease when found in intestinal biopsies. Inflammation of the mucosa and submucosa (Option A) is a general finding in many inflammatory conditions, including ulcerative colitis (UC). Intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Option B) are characteristic of viral infections like CMV colitis, which is less likely in an immunocompetent patient. Neutrophilic inflammation of crypts (cryptitis) (Option C) is a common finding in various forms of acute colitis, including UC, but is less specific for CD. Poorly differentiated gland-forming cells with dysplasia (Option E) are characteristic of adenocarcinoma, not inflammatory bowel disease."

  "question": "A 55-year-old man with a long history of alcohol abuse has abdominal pain, anorexia, and weakness. Exam reveals an enlarged and tender liver. Which finding on laboratory evaluation is most indicative of impaired hepatic function?",
  "choices": [
    "AST/ALT > 2",
    "Azotemia",
    "Increased serum alkaline phosphatase",
    "Increased serum albumin",
    "Prolonged prothrombin time"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient's history of alcohol abuse and an enlarged, tender liver are classic signs of alcoholic liver disease. Impaired hepatic function, meaning the liver's ability to synthesize proteins and clotting factors, is best assessed by tests reflecting its synthetic capacity. Prothrombin time (PT) reflects the synthesis of clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) by the liver, and a prolonged PT (Option E) is a sensitive indicator of acute or chronic hepatocellular dysfunction. Serum albumin (Option D) is also a measure of hepatic synthetic function, but its half-life is longer, making it less sensitive for acute changes compared to PT. AST/ALT ratio > 2 (Option A) is suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis but indicates hepatocellular injury, not directly synthetic function. Azotemia (Option B) indicates kidney dysfunction. Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (Option C) suggests cholestasis or bone disease, not primary hepatic synthetic function."

  "question": "Blood tests are obtained to evaluate liver function in a 44-year old man with chronic hepatitis B infection. Which of the following is a test of liver function?",
  "choices": [
    "Albumin",
    "Alk-P",
    "ALT",
    "AST",
    "Creatinine"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "When evaluating liver function, we assess the liver's synthetic capacity and its ability to excrete bilirubin. Among the given options, albumin (Option A) is a protein synthesized by the liver, and its serum level directly reflects the liver's synthetic function. A low albumin level can indicate chronic liver dysfunction. Alk-P (Alkaline Phosphatase, Option B), ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase, Option C), and AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase, Option D) are primarily markers of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis, not direct measures of liver function. Creatinine (Option E) is a marker of kidney function, not liver function."

  "question": "A 70-year-old man presents to an urgent care clinic with increased right upper quadrant abdominal pain and jaundice. His past medical history includes alcoholic liver disease. A month ago, he was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, which was considered inoperable, and he underwent local chemotherapy. Relevant labs include total serum bilirubin of 18 mg/dL and undetectable urine urobilinogen. What is the most likely cause of his current presentation?",
  "choices": [
    "Biliary obstruction",
    "Drug-induced liver injury",
    "Intravascular hemolysis",
    "Resumption of alcohol use",
    "UDP-glucuronyltransferase deficiency"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with jaundice (elevated total bilirubin of 18 mg/dL) and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The key laboratory finding is undetectable urine urobilinogen despite severe hyperbilirubinemia. Urobilinogen is formed in the intestines from conjugated bilirubin. If there is a complete or near-complete biliary obstruction (Option A), conjugated bilirubin cannot reach the intestines, leading to a lack of urobilinogen formation and thus undetectable levels in the urine. This pattern is characteristic of obstructive jaundice. Given his history of hepatocellular carcinoma, tumor progression causing biliary obstruction is a very likely scenario. Drug-induced liver injury (Option B) or resumption of alcohol use (Option D) would typically present with elevated liver enzymes and potentially some urobilinogen. Intravascular hemolysis (Option C) would cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and increased urine urobilinogen. UDP-glucuronyltransferase deficiency (Option E, e.g., Crigler-Najjar or Gilbert syndrome) causes unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia."

    "Lisinopril",
    "Norepinephrine",
    "Vancomycin",
    "Lactulose"

  "explanation": "The patient has end-stage liver disease, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and now presents with severe hypotension (BP 80/45 mmHg), tachycardia (142/min), cool extremities, and unresponsiveness to IV fluids. This clinical picture is indicative of distributive shock, most likely septic shock due to the SBP. In septic shock unresponsive to fluids, vasopressors are required to maintain mean arterial pressure and ensure adequate tissue perfusion. Norepinephrine (Option C) is the first-line vasopressor for septic shock. Ceftriaxone (Option A) and Vancomycin (Option D) are antibiotics, which are crucial for SBP but not for immediate hemodynamic support in shock. Lisinopril (Option B) is an ACE inhibitor, which would worsen hypotension. Lactulose (Option E) is used for hepatic encephalopathy but would not address the severe shock."

    "Deficiency of aldosterone",
    "Deficiency of cortisol",
    "Septic shock",
    "Upregulation of ACTH"

  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with signs of severe infection (fever, productive cough, crackles, left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and bands), which has progressed to hypotension (BP 90/70 mmHg) and tachycardia. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of septic shock (Option D) secondary to pneumonia. His long-term use of prednisone (a corticosteroid) could potentially suppress the HPA axis, but the presentation is more acutely consistent with a systemic inflammatory response to infection leading to distributive shock, rather than isolated adrenal insufficiency. Cardiogenic shock (Option A) is less likely given the absence of signs of heart failure (e.g., elevated JVP, crackles not diffuse) and the primary respiratory infection. Deficiency of aldosterone (Option B) would typically cause hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, and while he is hyponatremic (Na 131), hyperkalemia is not mentioned. Deficiency of cortisol (Option C) can cause hypotension, but in the context of a severe infection with systemic inflammatory response, septic shock is a more encompassing diagnosis. Upregulation of ACTH (Option E) would lead to increased cortisol, not deficiency."

Which of the following would be most helpful in determining the source of the elevated alkaline phosphatase?",
  "choices": [
    "Bone scan",
    "Erythrocyte sedimentation rate",
    "Serum calcitonin",
    "Serum carcinoembryonic antigen",
    "Serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient has elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (Alk-P), which can originate from various sources, primarily liver (biliary tract) or bone. To differentiate between these sources, an additional liver enzyme, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (Option E), is very helpful. GGT is also elevated in cholestatic liver disease (biliary obstruction) and alcohol abuse, but it is not elevated in bone disorders. Therefore, if Alk-P is elevated and GGT is also elevated, the source is likely hepatic. If Alk-P is elevated but GGT is normal, the source is likely bone. The patient's history of knee pain and stiffness (suggesting arthritis) could potentially indicate a bone source, but GGT would confirm a hepatic origin. A bone scan (Option A) might show increased bone turnover, but GGT is a more direct biochemical test to differentiate. ESR (Option B) is a non-specific inflammatory marker. Serum calcitonin (Option C) is a marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (Option D) is a tumor marker, but not specific for differentiating Alk-P source."

    "Portal hypertension",
    "Protein C deficiency"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient has a history of hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. His physical exam findings of splenomegaly and a venous pattern on the chest and abdomen (suggesting collateral circulation, like caput medusae) are classic signs of portal hypertension. Coughing up bright red blood (hematemesis) in a patient with portal hypertension is most commonly due to bleeding from esophageal varices, which develop as a consequence of increased pressure in the portal venous system. Portal hypertension (Option D) is the most likely cause of his bleeding. While liver disease can cause deficiency in clotting factors (Option B), the specific presentation with portal hypertension signs strongly points to variceal bleeding. Bronchogenic carcinoma (Option A) would cause hemoptysis, not typically hematemesis. An eroded gastric ulcer (Option C) is possible but less specific given the signs of portal hypertension. Protein C deficiency (Option E) is a thrombophilia, which would cause clotting, not bleeding."

  "question": "A 55-year-old woman, status post chemotherapy for advanced stage papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, is found to have an increased CA-125 on a clinical follow-up visit. Physical exam reveals an abdominal fluid wave. Paracentesis yields fluid serum-ascites albumin gradient <1.1 g/dL. Chest X-ray is unremarkable. Which of the following complications has she most likely developed?",
  "choices": [
    "Hematogenous metastases to the bone marrow",
    "Pelvic carcinomatosis",
    "Pelvic lymph node metastasis",
    "Portal hypertension with ascites",
    "Renal failure with oliguria and fluid retention"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient has a history of advanced ovarian cancer, an elevated CA-125 (a tumor marker for ovarian cancer), and new-onset ascites (abdominal fluid wave). The key finding from the paracentesis is a fluid serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) <1.1 g/dL. A low SAAG (<1.1 g/dL) indicates that the ascites is likely caused by a non-portal hypertensive process, such as malignancy (peritoneal carcinomatosis), pancreatitis, or nephrotic syndrome. Given her history of advanced ovarian cancer and elevated tumor marker, the most likely cause of her ascites is diffuse metastatic spread of the ovarian cancer to the peritoneum, known as pelvic carcinomatosis (Option B), which leads to fluid accumulation due to increased capillary permeability and lymphatic obstruction. Hematogenous metastases to bone marrow (Option A) or pelvic lymph node metastasis (Option C) do not directly explain ascites. Portal hypertension with ascites (Option D) would typically have a high SAAG (â¥1.1 g/dL). Renal failure (Option E) would cause generalized edema, not typically isolated ascites with this SAAG."

  "question": "A 47-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis has now developed abdominal distension and fluid wave. Mental status, CBC, and CMP are stable. Appropriate therapy at this time includes Na restriction and which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "ACE inhibitor",
    "Hydrochlorothiazide",
    "Lactulose",
    "Spironolactone",
    "Prophylactic TIPS"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis and has developed ascites (abdominal distension and fluid wave). Management of ascites in cirrhosis primarily involves sodium restriction and diuretics. Among the diuretic options, spironolactone (Option D) is the first-line pharmacologic agent for ascites in cirrhosis because it is an aldosterone antagonist that counteracts the hyperaldosteronism commonly seen in cirrhosis, leading to increased sodium and water excretion. ACE inhibitors (Option A) and hydrochlorothiazide (Option B) are generally not first-line for cirrhotic ascites and can be detrimental due to effects on renal perfusion or electrolyte imbalances. Lactulose (Option C) is used for hepatic encephalopathy, not directly for ascites. Prophylactic TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt, Option E) is reserved for refractory ascites or variceal bleeding, not initial management."

  "question": "Tissue obtained via a needle biopsy of the liver in a 45-year-old woman with alcoholism is stained with Masson trichrome to detect the presence of: which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Acidophilic bodies",
    "Bilirubin pigment in hepatocytes",
    "Fibrosis",
    "Macrovesicular steatosis",
    "Mallory's hyaline"

  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "Masson trichrome stain is a histological stain commonly used to highlight collagen and fibrous tissue in biopsy specimens. In the context of liver pathology, especially in a patient with alcoholism, it is used to detect and assess the presence and extent of fibrosis (Option C). Fibrosis is a key pathological feature of chronic liver injury that can progress to cirrhosis. Acidophilic bodies (Option A, e.g., Councilman bodies, apoptotic hepatocytes), bilirubin pigment (Option B), macrovesicular steatosis (Option D, large fat droplets in hepatocytes), and Mallory's hyaline (Option E, also known as Mallory bodies, cytoplasmic inclusions of damaged intermediate filaments seen in alcoholic liver disease) are all features that can be seen in alcoholic liver disease but are typically identified with H&E staining or other specific stains, not primarily Masson trichrome."

  "question": "A 37-year-old man with a history of alcoholic liver disease is evaluated for lethargy, confusion and asterixis. Physical exam reveals gynecomastia and caput medusae. Which laboratory finding is indicative of his impaired liver function?",
  "choices": [
    "Decreased serum BUN",
    "Decreased serum sodium",
    "Increased serum albumin",
    "Increased serum alkaline phosphatase",
    "Increased serum alanine aminotransferase"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with lethargy, confusion, asterixis, gynecomastia, and caput medusae are all classic signs of advanced liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is primarily due to the liver's impaired ability to detoxify ammonia into urea via the urea cycle. Therefore, a key laboratory finding indicative of this impaired synthetic (detoxification) function would be decreased serum BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) (Option A), as the liver is failing to produce urea. Increased serum albumin (Option C) would indicate *good* synthetic function, which is contradictory. Decreased serum sodium (Option B) can occur in cirrhosis due to dilutional hyponatremia from fluid retention, but it's not a direct indicator of impaired liver function in the same way BUN is for ammonia detoxification. Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (Option D) suggests cholestasis, and increased serum alanine aminotransferase (Option E) suggests hepatocellular injury, but neither directly reflects the impaired detoxification capacity as well as BUN in this context."

  "question": "A 70-year-old man reports to his physician because of noticeable yellowing of the sclera of his eyes over the past two days accompanied by dull upper abdomen pain, particularly after meals. Metabolic panel and urinalysis reveal the following pertinent positives: Total bilirubin 16.4 mg/dL (Nâ¤1.2), AST 98 U/L (Nâ¤40), ALT 89 U/L (Nâ¤40), Alk Phos 280 U/L (Nâ¤130), Urine color brown, Urine bilirubin 2+. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Alcoholic liver disease",
    "Cholelithiasis",
    "Excess hemolysis",
    "Hepatitis B infection",
    "Hepatotoxic drug effects"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with acute onset of jaundice (yellow sclera, elevated total bilirubin and direct bilirubin, brown urine with 2+ bilirubin), dull upper abdominal pain (post-prandial). The elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) is out of proportion to the AST and ALT elevations, strongly indicating a cholestatic pattern. This combination of symptoms and lab findings, particularly acute onset, points towards an obstructive cause of jaundice. Cholelithiasis (gallstones) (Option B) is a common cause of biliary obstruction leading to cholestasis and jaundice. Alcoholic liver disease (Option A), Hepatitis B infection (Option D), and Hepatotoxic drug effects (Option E) primarily cause hepatocellular jaundice with more pronounced AST/ALT elevations, and usually not acute obstructive features. Excess hemolysis (Option C) would cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not significant direct hyperbilirubinemia or elevated alkaline phosphatase."

  "question": "A 28-year-old man with a history of excessive alcohol use, multiple arrests due to DUI, and severe withdrawal symptoms is referred to an addiction specialist. Evidence-based long-term therapeutic intervention is most likely to include which of the following?",
  "choices": [
    "Daily attendance of Alcoholics Anonymous",
    "Long-term use of benzodiazepines",
    "Long-term use of naltrexone",
    "Psychotherapy with an alcohol and drug counselor"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient has a history of excessive alcohol use, DUIs, and severe withdrawal, indicating a significant alcohol use disorder. For long-term therapeutic intervention to prevent relapse in alcohol use disorder, evidence-based pharmacotherapies are often utilized. Naltrexone (Option C) is an opioid receptor antagonist that helps reduce alcohol cravings and the pleasurable effects of alcohol, and it is a well-established long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder. Daily attendance of Alcoholics Anonymous (Option A) is a valuable peer-support program but is not the sole or most direct 'therapeutic intervention' in a pharmacological sense, and is often combined with other treatments. Long-term use of benzodiazepines (Option B) is used for acute alcohol withdrawal management but is generally contraindicated for long-term treatment due to abuse potential and tolerance. Psychotherapy with a counselor (Option D) is an important component of treatment but often combined with pharmacotherapy for better outcomes, and is not the *most likely* sole intervention implied by the options that include pharmacologic agents."

  "question": "A 45-year-old man with chronic alcoholic liver disease has cutaneous spider telangiectasias, gynecomastia and testicular atrophy. These physical findings are most directly related to which abnormality?",
  "choices": [
    "Impaired hepatic conversion of estradiol to estriol",
    "Increased adrenal production of estrogen",
    "Increased hepatic degradation of FSH",
    "Increased hepatic degradation of testosterone",
    "Increased testicular resistance to FSH"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "The patient has chronic alcoholic liver disease with signs of feminization: spider telangiectasias, gynecomastia, and testicular atrophy. These findings are primarily due to hormonal imbalances in liver disease. The liver is responsible for metabolizing estrogens. In chronic liver disease, there is impaired hepatic inactivation of estrogens, leading to increased circulating levels of estrogen. Specifically, there is impaired hepatic conversion of estradiol (a potent estrogen) to less active forms like estriol (Option A). The increased estrogen levels contribute to gynecomastia and spider telangiectasias. Testicular atrophy is also related to these hormonal imbalances, with suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Increased adrenal production of estrogen (Option B) is not the primary mechanism. Increased hepatic degradation of FSH (Option C) or testosterone (Option D) are not the primary mechanisms; instead, it's impaired estrogen metabolism. Increased testicular resistance to FSH (Option E) is not the underlying cause of these systemic feminization signs."

  "question": "Image below represents a portion of liver biopsy obtained from a 45-year-old morbidly obese woman with a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes and elevated liver enzymes. Her alcohol intake consists of one glass of wine and a beer per week. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Alcoholic steatosis",
    "Cirrhosis",
    "Hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis",
    "Troglitazone-associated ballooning degeneration"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient is morbidly obese, has Type 2 Diabetes, and elevated liver enzymes, with minimal alcohol intake. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The image (if provided, typically showing steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning degeneration) in this context specifically points to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), which is the more inflammatory and progressive form of NAFLD. NASH (Option D) can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Alcoholic steatosis (Option A) is less likely given the minimal alcohol intake. Cirrhosis (Option B) is an end-stage fibrotic disease, but NASH is a diagnosis of the inflammatory stage preceding cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (Option C) is a complication of chronic liver disease but not the direct diagnosis of the underlying inflammatory process itself. Troglitazone-associated ballooning degeneration (Option E) refers to a specific drug-induced liver injury, but the overall context of obesity and diabetes points to NASH."

  "question": "A 50-year-old man with liver cirrhosis and refractory ascites and variceal bleeding is considered for TIPS (trans-jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). Which of the blood vessels depicted in the image below is inferior mesenteric vein?",
  "choices": [
    "A",
    "B",
    "C",
    "D",
    "E"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The question asks to identify the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) from the provided diagram of abdominal vasculature. The inferior mesenteric vein drains the hindgut structures (distal transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and superior rectum). It typically drains into the splenic vein (which then joins the superior mesenteric vein to form the portal vein). Without the actual image, it's impossible to definitively state which letter corresponds to the IMV. However, based on common anatomical diagrams used in medical education, 'D' often labels the inferior mesenteric vein. (Assuming standard anatomical labeling in common diagrams, where A might be portal vein, B splenic vein, C superior mesenteric vein, E renal vein or similar). In a typical diagram of portal circulation: A is likely hepatic portal vein, B is splenic vein, C is superior mesenteric vein, D is inferior mesenteric vein, and E might be a hepatic vein or renal vein."

Analysis of the fluid reveals a leukocyte count of 500/mm^3 with 70% neutrophils. Gram stain of the fluid is negative for microorganisms. What is the appropriate next step in the management?",
  "choices": [
    "Administer spironolactone",
    "Administer furosemide",
    "Perform a large volume paracentesis",
    "Administer cefotaxime",
    "Administer clarithromycin"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient has cirrhosis and ascites, and the paracentesis fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 500/mm^3 with 70% neutrophils. A polymorphonuclear (PMN) count of >= 250 cells/mm^3 in ascitic fluid is diagnostic of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), even if the Gram stain is negative (Gram stain is often negative in SBP). SBP is a severe complication of cirrhosis and requires immediate empirical antibiotic therapy to prevent high mortality. A third-generation cephalosporin, such as cefotaxime (Option D), is the first-line empirical antibiotic treatment for SBP due to its excellent coverage against common causative Gram-negative organisms (like E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Spironolactone (Option A) and furosemide (Option B) are diuretics for ascites management but do not treat infection. Large volume paracentesis (Option C) is a procedure to remove fluid but is not the primary treatment for SBP. Clarithromycin (Option E) is an antibiotic, but it is not typically used for SBP."

His daughter states that at baseline he lives alone and can complete all activities of daily living, but over the last day he has been more forgetful and disoriented. On exam, he has involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory eye movements and a wide based gait. What is the next best step in management of this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Ammonia level",
    "Blood cultures",
    "IV glucose",
    "IV thiamine",
    "Non-contrast head CT"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder and presents with acute confusion, disorientation, increased falls, and neurological signs like involuntary oscillatory eye movements (nystagmus or ophthalmoplegia) and a wide-based gait (ataxia). This constellation of symptoms is highly suggestive of Wernicke encephalopathy, which is caused by thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency, common in chronic alcoholics. Wernicke encephalopathy is a medical emergency that can rapidly progress to Korsakoff syndrome (irreversible memory impairment) or death if untreated. Therefore, the next best step in management is immediate administration of intravenous thiamine (Option D). While ammonia level (Option A) is relevant for hepatic encephalopathy (another cause of confusion in alcoholics), blood cultures (Option B) for sepsis, IV glucose (Option C) for hypoglycemia, and a head CT (Option E) for structural brain lesions, addressing acute thiamine deficiency is paramount and time-sensitive in this specific clinical picture."

His history is negative for significant medical problems, and he has no known allergies. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and drinks 4 to 6 beers in the evenings after work. He now has developed weakness, anorexia, and nausea. He has scleral icterus on exam and blood tests show elevation of AST and ALT to twice the upper limits of normal. What metabolic abnormality involving the liver contributed most to his acute condition?",
  "choices": [
    "Proliferation of stellate cells induced by acetaldehyde and acetaminophen",
    "Inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase by acetaminophen",
    "Excess accumulation of glutathione",
    "Inadequate glucuronidation and sulfation",
    "Induction of CYP2E1 leading to accumulation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient is taking 4 grams of acetaminophen daily (a potentially hepatotoxic dose) and has a history of daily alcohol consumption. He presents with symptoms and signs of acute liver injury (weakness, anorexia, nausea, scleral icterus, elevated AST/ALT). Acetaminophen overdose leads to liver injury primarily through the accumulation of a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Chronic alcohol consumption induces the activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in the liver. CYP2E1 is responsible for metabolizing alcohol, but it also metabolizes acetaminophen into toxic NAPQI. In this patient, chronic alcohol use would have induced CYP2E1, leading to increased formation of NAPQI from acetaminophen, overwhelming the liver's normal detoxification pathways (e.g., conjugation with glutathione). Therefore, the induction of CYP2E1 leading to accumulation of NAPQI (Option E) is the metabolic abnormality that most contributed to his acute liver condition. Option A (proliferation of stellate cells) is related to fibrosis. Option B (Inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase) is not the primary mechanism of acetaminophen toxicity. Option C (Excess accumulation of glutathione) is incorrect; glutathione is depleted, not accumulated. Option D (Inadequate glucuronidation and sulfation) can contribute but the key interaction here is CYP2E1 induction by alcohol."

    "â hepatic urea cycle ââ circulating [NH3]â cerebral astrocyte glutamine synthetaseâastrocyte glutamine ââ cerebral edema"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric complication of liver cirrhosis primarily caused by the impaired detoxification of ammonia (NH3) by the liver. In cirrhosis, the liver's ability to convert ammonia to urea via the hepatic urea cycle is compromised, leading to increased circulating ammonia (â circulating [NH3]). This ammonia then crosses the blood-brain barrier (â [NH3] in the brain). In the brain, astrocytes attempt to detoxify ammonia by converting it to glutamine via glutamine synthetase (â cerebral astrocyte glutamine synthetase â â astrocyte glutamine). The accumulation of glutamine within astrocytes leads to osmotic swelling and cerebral edema, which is the primary mechanism contributing to altered mental status. Option B best describes this sequence: Impaired hepatic urea cycle leads to increased circulating ammonia, which then increases ammonia in the brain. Astrocytes in the brain attempt to convert this ammonia to glutamine via glutamine synthetase, leading to increased astrocyte glutamine and cerebral edema. The slight variations in the options make Option B the most accurate and complete description."

His wife reports that he has been increasingly confused over the past few days and has been experiencing difficulty with memory. On physical examination, the patient is disoriented and exhibits asterixis. Additionally, examination of his palms reveals a reddish discoloration. Further assessment reveals a palpable ridge-like mass on the scalp. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum ammonia levels. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the presence of palmar erythema and the scalp finding in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Decreased activation of vitamin A",
    "Decreased synthesis of testosterone",
    "Decreased synthesis of aldosterone",
    "Increased activation of vitamin D",
    "Increased production of estrogen"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 4,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with signs of chronic liver disease (altered mental status, asterixis, elevated ammonia) and physical findings characteristic of chronic liver failure: palmar erythema (reddish discoloration of palms) and a palpable ridge-like mass on the scalp (consistent with caput medusae, dilated veins radiating from the umbilicus, a sign of portal hypertension). Palmar erythema and spider angiomas (not explicitly mentioned but related to flushed face in previous Q) are primarily attributed to the liver's impaired ability to metabolize and inactivate circulating estrogens. This leads to increased circulating estrogen levels (Option E), causing vasodilation. Caput medusae, on the other hand, is a manifestation of portal hypertension, leading to collateral circulation and dilated veins. While not directly hormonal, it's often seen alongside the hormonal stigmata of liver disease. Decreased activation of vitamin A (Option A) and D (Option D) are related to fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in liver disease, but do not cause these specific skin findings. Decreased synthesis of testosterone (Option B) contributes to gynecomastia and testicular atrophy but not directly palmar erythema. Decreased synthesis of aldosterone (Option C) would lead to hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, not these skin changes."

On physical examination, the patient appears lethargic and disoriented. Neurologic examination reveals intermittent lapses in muscle tone in her outstretched hands, which are associated with a characteristic flapping tremor. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum ammonia levels. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in narrowing down the etiology of the observed neurologic finding?",
  "choices": [
    "Administering intravenous thiamine supplementation",
    "Initiating treatment with lactulose and rifaximin",
    "Ordering liver function tests to assess for hepatic encephalopathy",
    "Obtaining a serum ammonia level to confirm hyperammonemia",
    "Performing a head CT scan to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient presents with classic signs and symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy (HE): a history of cirrhosis, increasing confusion, difficulty with coordination, lethargy, disorientation, and asterixis ('flapping tremor'). Elevated serum ammonia levels are a hallmark of HE. While the clinical presentation is highly suggestive, confirming the presence of hyperammonemia with a serum ammonia level (Option D) is the most appropriate next step to help narrow down the etiology of these neurologic findings and support the diagnosis of HE. Administering thiamine (Option A) is for Wernicke encephalopathy. Initiating lactulose and rifaximin (Option B) is the treatment for HE, but diagnosis should precede treatment. Ordering liver function tests (Option C) might provide general information about liver function but would not be the *most* direct test to confirm the cause of the neurological symptoms. A head CT scan (Option E) is important to rule out other causes of altered mental status (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage) but would typically be done after confirming metabolic causes like HE."

  "choices": [
    "Absence of a serine protease inhibitor",
    "Defective copper transportation",
    "Defective transferrin receptor binding",
    "Ethanol mediated liver injury",
    "Viral Infection targeting hepatocytes"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's constellation of symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia indicating diabetes mellitus; loss of libido, testicular atrophy indicating hypogonadism), physical findings (darkened skin, firm mass in RUQ indicating hepatomegaly), elevated blood glucose, and liver biopsy showing coarse granular brown pigment (hemosiderin) within hepatocytes is classic for hereditary hemochromatosis. The pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis involves a genetic defect, most commonly in the HFE gene, which leads to defective transferrin receptor binding (Option C) and disregulation of hepcidin synthesis. This results in inappropriately increased iron absorption from the gut, leading to iron overload and deposition in various organs, including the liver, pancreas, heart, joints, and endocrine glands (like the pituitary leading to hypogonadism). Option A (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) causes liver disease but with a different genetic basis. Option B (defective copper transportation) describes Wilson's disease. Options D (ethanol mediated liver injury) and E (viral infection targeting hepatocytes) describe other causes of liver disease, but do not explain the systemic iron overload or specific genetic defect in hemochromatosis."

    "question": "A 47-year-old woman is found to have hypercalcemia on routine bloodwork. She reports fatigue and constipation. Labs show elevated PTH and calcium levels, with low phosphate levels. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Tetany with carpopedal spasm",
      "Nephrolithiasis",
      "Hypopigmentation of the skin",
      "Increased bone density",
      "Elevated serum calcitonin"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient has primary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by elevated PTH and calcium with low phosphate. Common complications include nephrolithiasis due to hypercalciuria. Tetany occurs in hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia. Hyperparathyroidism is associated with decreased bone density (osteitis fibrosa cystica), not increased bone density. Skin pigmentation changes and elevated calcitonin are not characteristic features."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with central obesity, easy bruising, and new-onset hypertension. Labs reveal elevated cortisol and ACTH levels. MRI shows a pituitary mass. Which of the following explains the patient's hyperpigmentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Direct cortisol stimulation of melanocytes",
      "Excess aldosterone leading to skin sodium loss",
      "POMC-derived MSH production along with ACTH",
      "Overproduction of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla",
      "Upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "In Cushing's disease (pituitary ACTH-secreting tumor), POMC is cleaved into ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), both of which increase pigmentation. Cortisol does not directly stimulate melanocytes. Aldosterone excess affects sodium retention, not pigmentation. Epinephrine and tyrosine hydroxylase are unrelated to skin pigmentation."

    "question": "A patient with long-standing diabetes is found to have postural hypotension, decreased cortisol, and low aldosterone levels. Further workup confirms Addison’s disease. Which of the following is the most significant clinical concern in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Hyperkalemia-induced muscle paralysis",
      "Inability to mount a stress response during infection or surgery",
      "Risk of hypoglycemia from impaired insulin secretion",
      "Delayed wound healing due to low androgens",
      "Excessive vasoconstriction due to epinephrine excess"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The most serious risk in adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is an Addisonian crisis, triggered by stress when the body cannot produce adequate cortisol. This can be fatal without proper steroid replacement. Hyperkalemia can occur but is not the primary life-threatening issue. Addison’s patients are prone to hypoglycemia due to low cortisol, but the stress response deficit is more dangerous. Wound healing is less affected by adrenal androgens. Epinephrine is typically low or normal in Addison’s."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with episodic headaches, palpitations, and sweating. Blood pressure is persistently elevated. Plasma metanephrines are markedly increased. Which of the following is the primary source of his symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Increased cortisol release from the adrenal cortex",
      "Unopposed vagal activation",
      "Excess norepinephrine and epinephrine from a chromaffin cell tumor",
      "Decreased breakdown of dopamine",
      "Increased aldosterone-induced sodium retention"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient has a pheochromocytoma, a tumor of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells that secretes excess catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), causing episodic hypertension, headaches, and sweating. Cortisol excess causes Cushing’s syndrome, not these symptoms. Vagal activation lowers heart rate and BP. Dopamine metabolism is not the key issue here. Aldosterone excess causes hypertension but not paroxysmal sympathetic symptoms."

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents with weight loss, heat intolerance, and palpitations. On exam, she has exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema. Her thyroid is diffusely enlarged and non-nodular. Laboratory tests show low TSH and elevated free T4. Which of the following is the primary pathogenic mechanism of this patient’s condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Autoantibodies targeting thyroglobulin",
      "Thyroid follicular cell destruction by cytotoxic T cells",
      "Inhibitory antibodies to TSH receptor",
      "Activating antibodies to TSH receptor",
      "Gain-of-function mutations in the TSH receptor gene"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "This patient has Graves disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The key pathogenic mechanism is the presence of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI), which are activating antibodies directed at the TSH receptor, causing increased thyroid hormone production and follicular hyperplasia. Destruction by cytotoxic T cells is a feature of Hashimoto thyroiditis. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are seen in Hashimoto but do not drive hyperthyroidism. Inhibitory antibodies would cause hypothyroidism. TSHR gene mutations are seen in toxic adenomas or nodules, not in diffuse Graves disease."

    "question": "A 52-year-old woman presents with a firm, painless goiter. Laboratory tests reveal elevated TSH and low free T4. Her serum is positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. A biopsy would most likely reveal which of the following histologic features?",
    "choices": [
      "Follicular hyperplasia with resorbed colloid",
      "Psammoma bodies with papillary structures",
      "Oncocytic (Hürthle) cell metaplasia with lymphoid infiltrates",
      "Undifferentiated pleomorphic giant cells with necrosis",
      "Medullary carcinoma with amyloid deposition"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, germinal centers, follicular cell atrophy, and oncocytic (Hürthle) cell metaplasia. Follicular hyperplasia with colloid resorption is seen in Graves disease. Psammoma bodies and papillary structures are diagnostic for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Pleomorphic giant cells with necrosis describe anaplastic carcinoma. Medullary carcinoma is associated with C-cell proliferation and amyloid deposits."

      "Papillary thyroid carcinoma",
      "Follicular thyroid carcinoma",
      "Medullary thyroid carcinoma",
      "Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma",
      "Follicular variant of papillary carcinoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Anaplastic (undifferentiated) thyroid carcinoma is a highly aggressive tumor seen in older adults. It presents with rapidly growing masses causing compressive symptoms and histologically shows spindle cells, giant cells, pleomorphism, mitoses, and necrosis. Papillary carcinoma is indolent and well-differentiated. Follicular carcinoma requires capsular or vascular invasion but remains differentiated. Medullary carcinoma arises from C cells and stains positive for calcitonin. Follicular variant of papillary carcinoma retains nuclear features of papillary carcinoma and is not undifferentiated."

      "Hurthle cell metaplasia",
      "Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism",
      "Mucosal neuromas",
      "RET/PTC rearrangement"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "MEN2B is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, mucosal neuromas, marfanoid habitus, and pheochromocytoma. Psammoma bodies are seen in papillary carcinoma. Hurthle cells are seen in Hashimoto thyroiditis. Hypocalcemia is seen in hypoparathyroidism or post-surgical parathyroid removal. RET/PTC rearrangement is a driver of papillary carcinoma, whereas MEN2B involves germline RET proto-oncogene mutations."

    "question": "A 62-year-old woman presents with fatigue, constipation, muscle weakness, and recurrent nephrolithiasis. Labs reveal elevated serum calcium and PTH levels with low phosphate. A parathyroid mass is surgically removed. Histology shows a hypercellular encapsulated mass composed of chief cells with no appreciable stromal fat and no capsular or vascular invasion. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Parathyroid hyperplasia",
      "Parathyroid carcinoma",
      "Primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma",
      "Tertiary hyperparathyroidism",
      "Secondary hyperparathyroidism"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This is classic parathyroid adenoma, the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Histology typically shows a single, encapsulated hypercellular mass of chief cells with minimal or absent adipose tissue. It lacks the invasive features seen in carcinoma and is distinct from multiglandular hyperplasia. Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism typically involve multiple glands and are associated with chronic renal disease or vitamin D deficiency."

    "question": "A 58-year-old man with end-stage renal disease develops hypercalcemia and markedly elevated PTH levels despite long-term treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Imaging reveals multiple enlarged parathyroid glands. Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Neoplastic transformation of hyperplastic parathyroid glands",
      "Autoimmune destruction of parathyroid tissue",
      "Overexpression of parafibromin",
      "Reduced intestinal calcium absorption due to loss of villi",
      "Excess secretion of calcitonin from C-cells"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "This patient has tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which results from neoplastic transformation of previously hyperplastic parathyroid glands in the setting of chronic secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is marked by autonomous PTH secretion and hypercalcemia, even after the inciting renal disease has been managed. Autoimmunity is seen in hypoparathyroidism, parafibromin is lost (not overexpressed) in parathyroid carcinoma, and calcitonin is secreted by thyroid C-cells, not parathyroid glands."

      "Pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma",
      "Mucosal neuromas and medullary thyroid carcinoma",
      "Pituitary adenoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor",
      "Lung carcinoid and parathyroid carcinoma",
      "Adrenal cortical carcinoma and thyroid follicular adenoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient has MEN1, which is characterized by the '3 Ps': parathyroid adenomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., insulinomas, gastrinomas), and pituitary adenomas. It is due to a mutation in the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene (menin) on chromosome 11q13. MEN2A and MEN2B involve RET mutations and are associated with pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma. Lung carcinoids and adrenal cortical carcinomas are not hallmark tumors of MEN1."

    "question": "A 63-year-old man presents with severe hypercalcemia, bone pain, and a palpable neck mass. Lab results show markedly elevated PTH. Surgical pathology reveals invasion of the tumor into adjacent soft tissue and vascular structures. Immunohistochemistry shows loss of parafibromin staining. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Parathyroid adenoma",
      "Parathyroid carcinoma",
      "Atypical parathyroid tumor",
      "Parathyroid hyperplasia",
      "Lipoadenoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The presence of local tissue invasion, vascular invasion, and loss of parafibromin staining supports the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma, a rare but aggressive cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid adenomas are benign and lack invasive features. Atypical parathyroid tumors may have worrisome histology but do not show definitive invasion. Hyperplasia involves multiple glands and is non-invasive. Lipoadenoma is a benign tumor with abundant adipose tissue."

  "question": "A 28-year-old female presents to her physician complaining of amenorrhea and galactorrhea. She reports mild headaches but denies any visual changes. Her physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory tests show a serum prolactin level of 350 ng/mL (normal < 20 ng/mL) and normal levels of TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH. An MRI of the pituitary gland reveals a 0.8 cm sellar mass. The patient is prescribed cabergoline, which significantly improves her symptoms and reduces her prolactin level. Which of the following is the most likely pathological characteristic of this patient's pituitary mass?",
  "choices": [
    "Basophilic cells that are typically macro-adenomas and less responsive to medical therapy.",
    "Acidophilic cells that commonly present as macro-adenomas in males and post-menopausal females.",
    "Basophilic cells that are usually micro-adenomas and are often responsive to dopamine agonist therapy.",
    "Acidophilic cells that are the second most common functioning adenoma and cause insulin resistance.",
    "Chromophobe cells, with mass effect symptoms but no significant hormonal excess."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, significantly elevated prolactin (>200 ng/mL is almost always due to a prolactinoma), and a small sellar mass (0.8 cm is a micro-adenoma) is classic for a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas are the most common hyper-functioning pituitary adenomas (~50%). Histologically, prolactinomas are acidophilic (eosinophilic) cells, which can appear basophilic on H&E due to granular cytoplasm, and are predominantly micro-adenomas (90%). They are highly responsive to dopamine (D2R) agonists like cabergoline, which is the first-line medical treatment. Option A describes characteristics of ACTH-secreting adenomas (corticotrophs), which are basophilic but associated with Cushing's and not typically macro-adenomas. Option B correctly identifies prolactinomas as acidophilic cells; however, while males and post-menopausal females may present with macro-adenomas, this is not the most common presentation overall for prolactinomas (which are micro-adenomas). Option D describes growth hormone (somatotroph) adenomas, which are acidophilic and can cause insulin resistance, but the patient's symptoms are inconsistent with GH excess. Option E describes non-functioning adenomas, which do not cause hormonal excess like galactorrhea."

  "question": "A 68-year-old male presents with a history of increasing fatigue, cold intolerance, and constipation. He reports that his wife has noticed his face appears puffy and his skin feels dry. Laboratory tests reveal markedly decreased free T4 and significantly elevated TSH. Subsequent MRI of the pituitary gland shows diffuse enlargement of the anterior pituitary. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiologic process underlying the pituitary enlargement in this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Pituitary adenoma causing mass effect.",
    "Physiologic expansion due to elevated estrogen levels.",
    "Autoimmune lymphocytic infiltration of the anterior pituitary.",
    "Compensation for target organ failure by increased trophic hormone release.",
    "Neoplastic transformation of a pre-existing Rathke cleft cyst."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, puffy face, dry skin) and laboratory findings (low free T4, high TSH) are consistent with primary hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland (target organ) fails to produce sufficient thyroid hormone. This loss of negative feedback on the pituitary leads to compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the TSH-producing cells (thyrotrophs) in the anterior pituitary, resulting in pituitary enlargement. Option A is incorrect because the enlargement is reactive (hyperplasia), not an independent neoplastic adenoma. Option B is incorrect as physiologic pituitary expansion due to estrogen is seen in pregnancy, which is irrelevant for this elderly male. Option C describes lymphocytic hypophysitis, an inflammatory condition, but the direct hormonal feedback mechanism is the most common cause of pituitary enlargement in primary hypothyroidism. Option E is incorrect as Rathke cleft cysts are typically benign and do not undergo such neoplastic transformation leading to diffuse pituitary enlargement in response to primary hypothyroidism."

  "question": "A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of excruciating headache, blurred vision, and diplopia. His medical history includes a known non-functioning pituitary macro-adenoma diagnosed 2 years prior, which he has been monitoring. On examination, he is confused and has bilateral temporal hemianopsia and ophthalmoplegia. MRI reveals an acute hemorrhage within the pituitary mass. Which of the following is the most likely immediate management step for this patient?",
  "choices": [
    "Long-term dopamine agonist therapy.",
    "High-dose glucocorticoids and intravenous fluids.",
    "Radiation therapy to shrink the tumor.",
    "Trans-sphenoidal surgical resection as the sole initial treatment.",
    "Administration of desmopressin (DDAVP)."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This patient's presentation with sudden severe headache, visual disturbances (bitemporal hemianopsia, diplopia), altered consciousness, and a known pituitary mass with acute hemorrhage is classic for pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is an acute infarct +/- hemorrhage in a pituitary adenoma and constitutes a medical emergency. The immediate management involves supportive care with intravenous fluids and, critically, high-dose corticosteroids to prevent adrenal crisis (due to acute ACTH deficiency from pituitary compression/destruction). Option A (dopamine agonists) is primarily for prolactinomas and not the acute management for apoplexy. Option C (radiation therapy) is a long-term treatment, not an emergency intervention. Option D (trans-sphenoidal surgical resection) may be indicated, but it is typically performed after initial medical stabilization with fluids and corticosteroids, not as the sole immediate treatment. Option E (desmopressin) is used for central diabetes insipidus, which can be a complication but is not the immediate, universal treatment for the acute apoplexy itself."

  "question": "A 10-year-old boy presents with stunted growth and delayed puberty. His parents report he has been experiencing headaches, and he has recently developed bitemporal hemianopsia. Imaging reveals a large cystic-solid suprasellar mass with calcifications. Histology of the resected mass shows well-differentiated squamous islands with cysts, keratin flakes, and calcification. This patient's tumor is embryologically derived from which of the following structures?",
  "choices": [
    "Neural crest cells of the adrenal medulla.",
    "Outpouching of the third ventricle.",
    "Remnants of Rathke's pouch.",
    "Specialized cells of the anterior pituitary.",
    "Neuroglial cells of the posterior pituitary."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The patient's presentation with stunted growth, delayed puberty (endocrine dysfunction), headaches, bitemporal hemianopsia (mass effect on optic chiasm), and a cystic-solid suprasellar mass with calcifications is classic for a craniopharyngioma. The characteristic histology of squamous islands, cysts, keratin flakes, and calcification further confirms this diagnosis. Craniopharyngiomas are benign neoplasms embryologically derived from remnants of Rathke's pouch, which is an extension of the developing oral cavity that forms the anterior pituitary. Option A refers to pheochromocytomas or neuroblastomas. Option B refers to the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) embryology. Option D refers to pituitary adenomas. Option E refers to the cellular content of the posterior pituitary, not its embryonic origin."

  "question": "A public health researcher is analyzing factors contributing to health disparities in the United States. They note that despite significant healthcare expenditures, the U.S. lags behind other developed nations in key health outcomes like life expectancy and has high rates of preventable hospitalizations. The researcher is preparing a presentation on the multiple factors contributing to health outcomes, including health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and the physical environment. Which of the following statements best describes the financial landscape of public health efforts in the U.S. compared to healthcare expenditures, as presented in the provided data?",
  "choices": [
    "State public health expenditures per capita significantly exceed healthcare expenditures per capita, indicating a strong preventative focus.",
    "Both state public health expenditures and healthcare expenditures have seen significant growth in per capita spending over the last decade.",
    "Healthcare expenditures per capita are substantially higher than state public health expenditures per capita, with public health spending having decreased or shown no significant growth.",
    "State public health expenditures per capita are nearly equivalent to healthcare expenditures per capita, suggesting balanced investment.",
    "Per capita spending on public health has steadily increased since 2008, while healthcare expenditures have remained stagnant."
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The provided data highlights a significant imbalance in financial investment between public health and healthcare in the U.S. In 2018, state public health expenditures were $76 per capita, whereas healthcare expenditures were $11,600 per capita. Furthermore, the study results indicate that mean per capita state government spending for public health decreased from $80.40 in 2008 to $75.83 in 2018, and there was no significant growth in states' average per capita spending on public health after accounting for inflation between 2008 and 2018. This demonstrates that healthcare expenditures are vastly higher, and public health funding has not seen significant growth, or has even decreased, relative to inflation. This contrasts sharply with the idea of a strong preventative focus or balanced investment."

  "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 2-month history of fatigue, nervousness, and heat intolerance. She reports a 7-pound unintentional weight loss and frequent loose stools. She denies neck pain. On physical examination, her heart rate is 105 bpm, blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, and she has a fine hand tremor. Her thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged and non-tender. Laboratory studies reveal: TSH <0.01 µIU/mL (normal 0.4-4.0 µIU/mL) and Free T4 3.8 ng/dL (normal 0.8-1.8 ng/dL). A radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan is performed and shows diffuse, homogenous, increased uptake (48%). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Subacute thyroiditis",
    "Factitious thyrotoxicosis",
    "Toxic multinodular goiter",
    "Graves' disease",
    "Toxic adenoma"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "This patient's presentation with symptoms of hypermetabolism (fatigue, nervousness, heat intolerance, weight loss, loose stools, tachycardia, tremor) and suppressed TSH with elevated Free T4 indicates thyrotoxicosis. The key differentiating diagnostic step, as outlined in the provided material, is the radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan. Diffuse, homogenous, increased uptake on RAIU is the classic finding for Graves' disease. Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition where thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) stimulate the TSH receptors, leading to diffuse hyperplasia and hyperactivity of the entire thyroid gland. Subacute thyroiditis would typically present with neck pain and, crucially, a markedly decreased radioactive iodine uptake due to destructive inflammation. Factitious thyrotoxicosis (due to exogenous thyroid hormone intake) would also show decreased radioactive iodine uptake as the exogenous hormone suppresses endogenous production. Toxic multinodular goiter would show diffuse inhomogeneous uptake, indicating patchy areas of hyperactivity. A toxic adenoma would present with isolated increased uptake in a single nodule, not diffuse uptake."

  "question": "A 68-year-old man presents with progressive fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and a 10-pound weight gain over the past 6 months. His family notes that his voice has become hoarser. His past medical history includes hyperlipidemia and hypertension. On physical examination, his skin is dry and cool, and he has periorbital edema. His heart rate is 58 bpm and blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg. Deep tendon reflexes show a delayed relaxation phase. Laboratory results are obtained: TSH 15.5 µIU/mL (normal 0.4-4.0 µIU/mL), Free T4 0.4 ng/dL (normal 0.8-1.8 ng/dL). Based on this patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, which of the following lipid abnormalities is most likely to be present?",
  "choices": [
    "Decreased Total Cholesterol, Decreased LDL Cholesterol, Decreased HDL Cholesterol",
    "Increased Total Cholesterol, Increased LDL Cholesterol, Increased VLDL Cholesterol",
    "Increased HDL Cholesterol only",
    "Decreased Triglycerides, Increased HDL Cholesterol",
    "Normal lipid profile"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This patient presents with a classic constellation of symptoms and signs consistent with primary hypothyroidism (fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, weight gain, hoarseness, dry skin, periorbital edema, bradycardia, and delayed deep tendon reflex relaxation). The laboratory results of an elevated TSH and low Free T4 confirm overt primary hypothyroidism. The provided information on Plasma Lipoprotein Changes in Thyroid Disease indicates that hypothyroidism is associated with increased Total Cholesterol, increased LDL Cholesterol, and increased VLDL Cholesterol. This is due to reduced clearance of these lipoproteins. Conversely, hyperthyroidism tends to decrease these lipid levels. Therefore, given the clear diagnosis of hypothyroidism, increased Total, LDL, and VLDL cholesterol are the expected lipid abnormalities."

  "question": "A 52-year-old woman presents to her physician after discovering a lump in her neck during self-examination. She denies any pain, difficulty swallowing, or changes in voice. Her medical history is unremarkable, and she has no family history of thyroid cancer. However, she notes she received radiation therapy to her neck and chest for Hodgkin lymphoma when she was 15 years old. On physical examination, a solitary, firm, non-tender nodule is palpated in the right lobe of the thyroid. The remainder of the examination is normal. Initial laboratory results show a serum TSH of 1.5 µIU/mL (normal 0.4-4.0 µIU/mL). What is the next most appropriate step in the evaluation of this thyroid nodule?",
  "choices": [
    "Order a radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan",
    "Initiate thyroid hormone suppression therapy",
    "Perform a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule",
    "Observe the nodule with serial ultrasound examinations",
    "Proceed directly to surgical resection of the nodule"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "This patient has a palpable thyroid nodule with a normal serum TSH level. According to the evaluation pathway for thyroid nodules described in the provided material, if the serum TSH concentration is normal or elevated, there is a possibility that the nodule is neoplastic, and fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the next step in diagnosis. The patient's history of neck irradiation for Hodgkin lymphoma is a very significant risk factor for thyroid malignancy, further increasing the suspicion and the need for FNA, even with a normal TSH. A radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan is typically performed when TSH is low to determine if the nodule is 'hot' (hyperfunctioning) or 'cold' (non-functioning), as 'hot' nodules are rarely malignant. Thyroid hormone suppression therapy is sometimes used for benign nodules to attempt to shrink them but is not the initial diagnostic step, especially with a suspicious history. Observation with serial ultrasound is appropriate for very low-risk nodules after initial workup, or if FNA is indeterminate/benign but clinical suspicion remains. Direct surgical resection is not indicated as an initial step without a definitive diagnosis of malignancy via FNA or other strong indicators."

  "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents with anxiety, palpitations, and heat intolerance. She reports a 10-pound unintentional weight loss. Her laboratory results show a suppressed TSH (<0.01 µIU/mL) and elevated Free T4 (3.2 ng/dL). A radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan reveals a markedly decreased uptake (<5%). Upon further questioning, she denies any history of neck pain or recent viral illness. She is not taking any prescribed thyroid medications. However, her mother, who has hypothyroidism, recently started a new diet supplement, and the patient has been curious about it. Given these findings, what is the most likely explanation for the patient's thyrotoxicosis?",
  "choices": [
    "Graves' disease",
    "Toxic multinodular goiter",
    "Subacute thyroiditis",
    "Factitious thyrotoxicosis",
    "TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "This patient presents with thyrotoxicosis (suppressed TSH, elevated Free T4). The crucial diagnostic finding is the markedly decreased radioactive iodine uptake (<5%). This pattern indicates that the thyroid gland is not actively producing excess hormone, but rather that there is an excessive amount of circulating thyroid hormone from an external source or due to release from a damaged gland. Given the absence of neck pain (ruling out painful subacute thyroiditis) and the history of her mother taking a 'diet supplement' for hypothyroidism, the most likely explanation is factitious thyrotoxicosis. This occurs when a patient (sometimes unknowingly or intentionally) ingests exogenous thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland's endogenous production is suppressed, leading to low RAIU. Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter would both show increased RAIU, though with different patterns (diffuse homogenous for Graves', inhomogeneous for multinodular). Subacute thyroiditis would also show low RAIU, but it is typically associated with neck pain and a preceding viral illness. A TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma would present with elevated (or inappropriately normal) TSH and elevated thyroid hormones, and would show increased RAIU."

This combination of findings is characteristic of primary hyperparathyroidism. The parathyroid glands are autonomously secreting PTH, leading to increased calcium reabsorption from bone and kidneys, and increased phosphate excretion. Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) would also show high calcium and normal/modestly elevated PTH, but it is primarily characterized by low 24-hour urinary calcium excretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to Vitamin D deficiency would typically present with hypocalcemia (or low-normal calcium), hyperphosphatemia (if CKD is present), and elevated PTH as a compensatory response. Hypercalcemia of malignancy typically presents with suppressed PTH due to PTHrP secretion or direct bone metastases, and often a more rapid onset of symptoms. Hypoparathyroidism would present with hypocalcemia and low PTH."

  "question": "A 48-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis for 5 years presents with worsening generalized bone pain and muscle weakness. Laboratory results show: Serum calcium 7.5 mg/dL (normal 8.5-10.5 mg/dL), Serum phosphate 6.0 mg/dL (normal 2.5-4.5 mg/dL), and Intact PTH 450 pg/mL (normal 10-65 pg/mL). Her 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is 35 ng/mL (normal 30-100 ng/mL). Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of her elevated parathyroid hormone levels?",
  "choices": [
    "Autonomous PTH secretion from a parathyroid adenoma",
    "Decreased renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and hyperphosphatemia",
    "Increased parathyroid gland sensitivity to serum calcium",
    "Impaired degradation of PTH due to renal failure",
    "Mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and presents with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and significantly elevated intact PTH, which is characteristic of secondary hyperparathyroidism, specifically renal hyperparathyroidism. The primary drivers of elevated PTH in CKD are the kidneys' inability to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), and phosphate retention (hyperphosphatemia). Decreased calcitriol synthesis leads to reduced intestinal calcium absorption and loss of calcitriol's direct inhibitory effect on PTH secretion. Hyperphosphatemia further contributes by precipitating calcium, leading to hypocalcemia, and possibly by directly stimulating PTH secretion. Both of these factors lead to chronic stimulation and hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands. Autonomous PTH secretion from a parathyroid adenoma describes primary hyperparathyroidism. Increased parathyroid gland sensitivity to serum calcium is not a primary mechanism here; rather, the glands become less sensitive over time in severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (leading to tertiary hyperparathyroidism). While PTH degradation is impaired in renal failure, the primary pathophysiological trigger for the *elevation* is the altered mineral metabolism. Mutations in the CASR gene cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, which is a genetic disorder not relevant to this patient's ESRD-related issues."

  "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with carpal spasms, perioral numbness, and positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs after undergoing a thyroidectomy for Graves' disease 24 hours prior. Laboratory results show: Serum calcium 6.5 mg/dL (normal 8.5-10.5 mg/dL), Serum phosphate 4.8 mg/dL (normal 2.5-4.5 mg/dL), and Intact PTH 5 pg/mL (normal 10-65 pg/mL).

    "Hypoparathyroidism",
    "Pseudohypoparathyroidism",

  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "This patient presents with acute, symptomatic hypocalcemia (carpal spasms, perioral numbness, positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs) following thyroidectomy. Her laboratory results show markedly low serum calcium and, critically, a low intact PTH level. This combination of hypocalcemia and inappropriately low PTH is diagnostic of hypoparathyroidism, which in this context is most likely iatrogenic due to accidental removal or damage to the parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery. The 24-hour urine calcium is low, which is expected as the kidneys are attempting to conserve calcium in response to low PTH and hypocalcemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated PTH. Secondary hyperparathyroidism would show hypocalcemia with *elevated* PTH as a compensatory response. Pseudohypoparathyroidism involves target organ resistance to PTH, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and *elevated* PTH. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a cause of hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia, and is characterized by low urinary calcium excretion with normal or high PTH."

His creatinine clearance is 75 ml/min, and a DEXA scan shows a bone mineral density T-score of -1.8 at the hip. He has no history of kidney stones or fractures. An abdominal CT scan performed for an unrelated reason showed no evidence of nephrolithiasis. Considering the current guidelines, which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient at this time?",
  "choices": [
    "Parathyroidectomy",
    "Administration of bisphosphonates",
    "Initiation of calcimimetics",
    "Observation with twice-yearly clinical evaluation",
    "Dietary calcium restriction"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "This patient has primary hyperparathyroidism (elevated calcium, elevated PTH). The question asks for the most appropriate management *at this time* based on current guidelines. While parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism, it is typically recommended based on specific indications. According to the provided material (slide 13 and 14), indications for surgery include serum calcium >1 mg/dL above upper limit of normal, creatinine clearance <60 ml/min, bone mineral density T score < -2.5, radiologic evidence of vertebral fracture, 24-hour urinary calcium >400 mg with increased stone risk, presence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, or age <50 years. This patient's serum calcium is only slightly above normal (10.9 mg/dL, so <1 mg/dL above normal upper limit of 10.5 mg/dL), his creatinine clearance is 75 ml/min (not <60), his T-score is -1.8 (not < -2.5), he has no history of stones or fractures, and he is older than 50. Therefore, he does not meet current surgical criteria. In the absence of surgical indications, observation with twice-yearly clinical evaluation, ensuring adequate hydration, avoiding thiazide diuretics and extreme calcium diets, and possibly bisphosphonates, is the appropriate management. Bisphosphonates and calcimimetics are medical therapies that may be used, but initial management without surgical indication often begins with observation if the patient remains asymptomatic and does not meet surgical criteria. Dietary calcium restriction is generally not recommended in primary hyperparathyroidism as it can worsen bone health."

These findings are diagnostic of primary hyperaldosteronism, often referred to as Conn syndrome when caused by an adrenal adenoma. The presence of a unilateral adrenal mass on CT scan supports this diagnosis. Secondary hyperaldosteronism due to renal artery stenosis would present with elevated renin due to decreased renal perfusion. Adrenal cortical carcinoma could produce aldosterone, but it's less common as a sole manifestation and typically presents with more aggressive features or other hormone excesses, and the mass is often much larger. Cushing's syndrome involves cortisol excess and presents with different clinical features (e.g., central obesity, moon facies, striae) and different lab profiles (elevated cortisol, suppressed ACTH). Congenital adrenal hyperplasia involves deficiencies in steroid synthesis enzymes and presents differently, often earlier in life."

    "explanation": "This patient's presentation with ambiguous genitalia, salt-wasting (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, dehydration, feeding difficulties, weight loss) , and low cortisol and aldosterone is characteristic of the severe, salt-wasting form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The most common cause of CAH, accounting for over 90% of cases, is 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) deficiency. This enzyme deficiency blocks the synthesis pathways to cortisol and aldosterone, leading to their deficiency, while steroid precursors are shunted towards androgen production, causing virilization (ambiguous genitalia in females, enlarged genitalia in males). Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone is a hallmark of this deficiency. Other enzyme deficiencies like 11-beta-hydroxylase would also cause virilization but typically lead to hypertension due to deoxycorticosterone accumulation. 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency causes hypertension and hypokalemia with impaired sex steroid synthesis. 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency impairs synthesis of all major steroids, leading to ambiguous genitalia in both sexes and salt wasting. Cholesterol desmolase deficiency is a very rare and severe form affecting all steroid synthesis, typically lethal early in life."

    "explanation": "This patient's clinical picture of chronic adrenal insufficiency (fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia)  with high ACTH and prominent skin hyperpigmentation (due to elevated MSH co-secreted with ACTH)  indicates primary adrenal insufficiency. The long-standing nature of the disease and the presence of skin hyperpigmentation strongly favor a chronic cause. Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary chronic adrenal insufficiency in developed countries (60-70% of cases). The family history of thyroid problems further supports an autoimmune predisposition, as autoimmune adrenalitis can be part of autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS). Tuberculosis of the adrenal glands can cause primary adrenal insufficiency, but it is less common in developed countries. Metastatic carcinoma to the adrenal glands can also cause insufficiency but is usually seen in the context of advanced cancer and is less likely to be the cause of long-standing primary adrenal insufficiency diagnosed at a younger age. A pituitary adenoma would lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency, which would present with low ACTH and typically no hyperpigmentation, and usually preserved aldosterone.
